[Voice Talking:] But anyway I... I... I like to value my
Relationship with women. You know sometimes I get so
Deeply involved I just, I just have to feel like
Oral sex would complete our relationship

Sometimes goin' from behind (from behind)
Slowly strokin, no jokin

And then wash it down with a shot of whiskey

I remember when I spent the night at Sally's house
Woke up with Cotton Mouth
Couldn't speak
My tongue was weak
From Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Oh I love them mountain thighs
And a pizza pie before my eyes
But before I taste them juices
I make sure this Sally douches
But she's not the only one

But yo you know that I'm most happy

Whisper In their ear and make it clear

'Cause I'm not gonna say I love you when your sitting upon my face
Oh yes It's warm and wet
In the valley you bet (bet)
And get this, one girl I yodled on
Had a bush thicker than the amazon
Forest

Came out with hair on my toungue
But still I got the job done

Do what you have to
I do what I had to
To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue
And as I rank I wanna thank no one
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
You helped me around
My parents put me down
I never skipped town
I stood my ground
We kept showin up
Drinkin' and throwin' up
Rap was my life
As I was growin' up
Actin' a fool in school no one topped us
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious
Drivin' a bronco
Runnin' my own show
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes
And me and Bo got together
Made sense
Spent many nights in Mt. Clemens basements
I scratched records and performed a few tricks
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown
Now I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

F-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice
It's like the roll of the dice
For a whole new life
But don't get my song wrong
I enjoy it alot
Walkin' around like a big shot
'Cause I'm Kid Rock
Smooth as an ice cube
Cool as an igloo
And more complex, than a rubix cube
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run
And as I incline through time to get mine
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep
The one who finds is the one who seeks
So I sought and fought
And alot I got taught
And although I left those who stole got caught
Many shows I rocked
Many suckers I laughed at
And those who snapped back usually got slapped
The cat if I was strap
'Cause I was a sun of a gun
Livin' life on the run
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none
Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
And when in motown I cool out in Greektown
On the upside with nothin' too high
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
Chuck nice break that beat down
Uh huh... Uh huh... Uh huh
KDC... huh

Six Generations of rap and I'm first
Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed
I worked and worked and worked and I worked
When many thought I was just gettin' jerked
Used, abused, but I paid my dues
And now no one out there could fill my shoes
And my pants and do this dance
This shit didn't happen by chance
It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip
And now up and up and up I won't stop
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock
Yes me the low key MC
With the ability to rock a party
Anywhere and make people stare
I'm lookin' while I'm cookin with no care
Pumpin the new sound town to town
Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown
And still I won't stop growin' this flat top
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

Everything I do gonna be funny

New Player on the field so yield and get back
To the wall
'Cause I'm playin' ya all
Like a game
K-I-D is the name
Some complain
And they got a little fame
And it's a shame
For what its worth
I'm down with earth
Pourin it on like Ms. Butterworth
Rich and thick
Kinda quick not slow
The rhymes I fit into flow
All in a row, from the intro
To the end so, ho
Put down the microphone and go
Step a side as I make room to bloom
Any opposing goo gets placed in a tomb
As soon as I grip the mic to get loose
Don't dispute 'cause ya got no juice
Meanwhile I kick a rhyme from the pile
Huh, As I Cramp your style (style... style)

Cramp your style (Cramp your style... cramp your style)

Get down on your knees and pray when I break you
Down with a sound
Comin' down with a pound
Or a bang
If you can't hang with the slang
That I exploit
Comin' straight from Detroit
Rough without a doubt or a question
Kid Rock here in the flesh
And addressin and defining certain issues
To diss you (he diss me... aheo)
So wipe the tears from your eyes
You can't hide so don't be surprised
When I dismiss you from your throne
And send you home
As a Kid Rock clone
'Cause I can hold my own
Like ya hold a milkbone
Simple as this with a grip that won't quit
So when I hit the skit
That's it
So don't come in face with the base
And remember your just an imitation
Don't get buckwhile
In fact don't smile
'Cause I'll pull your file
As I Cramp your style (style... style)

Cramp your style (cramp your style... cramp your style)
I'll claim the boundries of my domain
Detroit... Detroit
Fresh, I'm from the Midwest
From MoTown... From MoTown

I'm like steel or concrete yo 'cause I'm the hardest
Down with a label known to be the largest
Not bein modest don't even think of tryin' to hang
Cause yo Kid Rock rolls like a Stop O
I roll thick
I roll heavy
D-Nice justs keeps the pace steady
So get ready to feel the pain
I'm Kid Rock drivin' girls insane
So listen rappers and get to the program
Breakin ya down is the Kid rock slogan
And any rapper who thinks about dissin
You know what I'll say?
I got a great big dick
So anyone who can't adjust
Gets rust
And then bites the dust
Be ready to walk a mile
'Cause I'll smack that Kool-Aid smile
As I Cramp your style (style... style)
Cramp your style (cramp your style... cramp your style)

Burnin
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no, oh no, here we go now
Oh no...

Went to New York to cut my first LP
Ridin' down Broadway in a taxi
Hang a right at 25th
Just a little too swift, jo'
Let me out, I'm gonna walk from here on
Heres four bucks you drive like a moron
Lost in the apple and I'm all alone

Cause New York's Not My Home

In the village just illin with a forty in a brown bag
I'm seein freaks, and also fags
I see a set of nice legs within in my site
But it's a fuckin' transvestite
Walkin' in the daylight
Now I'm trippin' and I'm like blown
But I take another sip and say to each his own
He'd get dissed in Detroit, but I'll leave him alone

Cause New York's Not My Home

Now if your sounds are knockin' to the cool Kid Rockin'
Has got your girl jockin
Take a chill pill young man, close your flap
Cause like the Piston Joe, I'm goin' back to back
With a track, uh, that's just too clean
I got my pistol packed and a fifth of Jim Beam
Only 19, and my name ain't Wilbur
But I pull more hoes then Long Jon Silver
I don't dress up, or try to look pretty
Instead I rock the house in every major city
From the tip of Maine to the coast of Cali
I get down and I yodle in the valley
Can't say I'm from the Bronx or Brookland zones

Cause New Yorks Not My Home

Eigth ave in the 40 deuce, it's like a freak show
A lot of hookers try to pop that weak, so
I walk with a limp when I pimp through
Or co-mack those hoes if I'm illin with the Beast Crew
It's pickin' up, ill check this fact
These Mother Fuckers pay over 2.50 for a big mac
Conjested, overcrowded, cya I'm gone

Cause New York's Not My Home

Bonnie shades
And a high top fade
So low you know on the mic with no aid
You didn't think in a blink no way
That I'd make the grade
But now you say I use to go to school with him
I use to go to dot dot bim
I use to know his older brother
I use to be his eigth grade lover
Talk is cheap and the speech is weak
He use to go with me, wrong you were my freak
I never gave a hoot
If a girl was cute
All I wanted was a piece and a knock the boots
And then they get dissed
Crossed off my list
Though a bend in my behind would get kissed
Just like so world the girls will go low
Just like Jock Custoe
And blow
Up come my drawers, see ya gotta go
It's to plain
Kid Rock's the name
And I run my game
From Frisco to Maine
Never fell in love
'Cause I'm a girl heartbreaker
But still I built my skills and I'm the

'Cause I'm the

Stop the madness
You never had this
Wild style of my b-boy badness
Runnin' the show
Clockin the dough
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo, but I'm not
I'm Kid Rock
Flat top and all
Not Michael Jackson spinnin singing off the wall
But making everyone how I thump like thunder
Got over like a mother
While you went straight under
And now you can't stand
The way I jam
Hold the mic in my hand
And rock the whole land
Man get jealous if you want to
But either way I'm gonna do what I have to do
'Cause I work to hard to make ends match
Started from scrath
And to a lot of crap
But now I'm like a wild horse no one can catch
And I'm a bad mother fucker
Believe that
I'll pop on top more flop no stop
Makin' every girl in the house want a piece of the rock
And then I'll bring a new swing
To make it understand the kid's running things
Mostly because I'm not an MC faker
And the rest because I'm the

Never thought about the other side, oh no
It was always lets go try to pull some hoes
And I pulled 'em like a tow-truck
Since I was a young buck
Guaranteed the hoes always got fucked
With a one-two and all that good shit
I never flipped or tripped or got pussy whipped
'Cause I'm K-K-K-K Kid Rock motherfucker
You wanna piece of me
You're just another sucker
But oh well you don't bother me none
Cause me and your girl have lots of fun
You know the one that looks like a model
Sucks on my nuts like a baby on a milk bottle
Not 'cause I make her, I wouldn't make her
But 'cause I mack her right, she loves me all night

With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody

Get down girl and read my mind
And you'll see that it's focused on your behind
You gotta lotta class and don't mind me askin
But can I go up in your fat ass
And just pump, pump, pump
What's next? check your money
It's scum and its time to jet
You bet she'll be into it more
On the bed the steps and the kitchen floor
You like the way the K-I-
Did it like I said I
Would, could, should I do it good
In your neighborhood
On your fuckin' block
'Cause I'm the coooool the Kid Rock
Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Kid Rock, Kid Rock, Kid Rock
Make it nasty

Hoes talk the same shit
Ya dress like a slob
But bitches still give a good blow-job
Up come my drawers and it's goodbye
The Kid Rock's just got to fly 'Cause it's 1-9-9-0
Time to fuck hoes
But before ya goin' put Jimmy in a lambskin
And we could bump all night you bet
So get set to jet and go get wet
Come on outta your girdle and slacks
And I'll shine that booty like turtle wax

With a one-two and all that good shit
With a one-two I take another sip
With a one-two and I'll rock this party
With a one-two ya better ask somebody
Bitch

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you know people are scared to have conversations
Like this and that's... and that's what it boils down to.
When you see a guy you already know whether not you want to fuck him,
Don't you?
[Girl:] Yep
[Voice Talking:] Guaranteed
[Girl:] Yep

All right we are gonna have a hot time in the old town tonight

See a fly skinny on the avenue
My shades down hat flipped on and on a cashew
Could not believe my eyes so I lifted up my shades
And this girl is starring at me as if she wanted to get laid
Next the girl started steppin and she crossed the street
She walked to me and at that my knees got weak
Then I snapped to realize that it was my duty
To get this freak and co-wax the booty

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty
Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I gotta freak freak so I am gonna wax her booty

Heading for the crib I was reciting some rhymes
When the freak cut in and started telling of the times
She wanted to rock me and these were no lies
And that is when I contracted the rise in my Levis
Step into my crib she said the rise impressed her
So without delay I began to undress her
Unstrapped her bra and whispered to her are you with me
She said yes so I grabbed them titties
Next was the test to see if she was high rank
I dropped her panties and was slippin, I asked do you stank
She said no and noted to me that her shower soap is Gucci
So I dropped my boxers and headed for her coochie
Headed fo her coochie
Grease it down real good
Headed for her coochie
Dang that's good

Now when I got to her coochie I looked close to see
If this girl had any types of signs of VD
She did not so I said to myself Oh goody
And I grabbed my dick and co-stuck in her puddy
Started rocking this freak with my hands on her butt
You should have seen in her booty I was tearin it up
Next I whispered in her ear baby please turn over
And rocked doggie style while I was calling her Rover
Still tearin it up on her face was a grin
Holdin' on to her waist pumping harder than sin
But she was lovin' it all with her back in a arch
I busted my nut and she started to bark
Arf... Arf... Arf
Uh
Arf... Arf... Arf
Uh
Arf... Arf... Arf
Na na bop but nop but

Now if you think the story is over just listen to this
I thought my mission was complete so I gave her a kiss
Then I was searchin for a towel to clean off my dickie
'Cause it was kinda wet all bloody and sticky
And to talk about gross heres something sicker than sick
The bitch dropped to her knees and licked the tip of my dick
I started trippin' cause this was something I've never seen
The girl was more than a freak she was a sexual fiend
And when I thought that was as gross as one girl could get
She stuck her finger in her booty and then she licked it
Oh now this girl was much more to me than a freak
In my opinion she was plain nasty
But never the less I completed my duty
I got this freak and co-waxed the booty

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I got the freak and I waxed her booty
I love the booty, you love the booty
Hey freak come here and let me wax your booty

Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop
Too short don't stop the beat
Hey yo short dog can I get a bitch
Biiiiiiiitch

Now if you like the booty come on fellas show it
This is your last verse to wax so why would you blow it
And if the ladies if you are tired of a man on your fanny
Then fuck you go home and watch the tube with granny
Cause this is booty night non stop
With the number one wax and me Kid Rock
So let's get hyped 'cause if I see you calm
I am gonna think that you are waxin with Rosie Palm
I mean really how could you be so dumb
Just look at all the girls that are dying to get some
Man, just don't be a wussy
And I'll guarantee you could get a piece of pussy
But to get it you have to realize
Don't brag to the freak about your dick size
Man, that's not the way to win it
Cause it is not the length of your wand it's the magic in it

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
Freaky freaky freak with the nice size booty

Wax that booty
Co-wax the booty
I got freaks and I wax those booties

[Voice Talking:] Yeah, but you... you know... you know what I'm sayin'.
What kind of Popsicle you like?
[Girl:] What kind of Popsicle?
[Voice Talkng:] Yeah
[Girl:] Don't matter
[Voice Talkng:] Huh?
[Girl:] It don't matter
[Voice Talking:] It don't matter?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] So what, you gonna do that to mine, ain't you?
[Girl:] Nope
[Voice Talking:] Well you ought to.
I mean you ought to go run to the store
And you know they would never know what you practicing for.
They'll like, "Girl you trying to put some weighty not a Popsicle
And in the back of your mind no I'm practicing to suck Kid Rock's dick.
You know? That would be kind of sweet, wouldn't it?

All the girls want a Kid Rock poster
And be able to both stay looked at
The number one pimp with the number one rap
What's up with that
Well I'm a cool cat
With the rap
That's harder than a pimp slap
And because I do so much pimpin'
One day I'll probably walk with a limp
And drive a big Lincoln
Wearin an unbuttoned shirt
And be a fifty-five year old pervert
But for now rap's the occupation
But one day watch I'll be Pimp Of The Nation

But watch one day I'll be Pimp Of The Nation

Uh
Kick on back to the rap I format
When its through what you do is just play it back
Rewind it
Find it
That's how I desinged it
And fellas if you see a big butt get behind it
And grind on it
I mean push and bump
'Cause it's about time we made this party jump
Take a drink of your forty
And let's get naughty
Get on the floor and just move your body to the sound
I found and also developed
Lets trip don't sit, come on get the hell up
Look at the black man, now what'd up
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut

Yeah... Yeah
Streets of Romeo
Mt. Clemens
Detroit
All over

Now people always me and KDC
If we take this activity a seriously
I reply, with a sigh rather uniquely
And say does Donald Trump have a lotta money
Yes a stupid question, but I won't quote ya
'Cause I'm the Geraldo, Philmore, Oprah
I'm the K-I-D R-O-C-K
Down with Jive, RCA
Hey how could you judge me 'cause what I am
Be blind to my mind
And take a look and say fuck him
Look at the black man, now what up
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut

Okay... Yeah
Like I said
Top Dog
One, two, to the three
And we always come back for more

Kenny wears a low fade
Danny wears no fade
I wear the high fade
And we all get paid
Tryin' to blow my rap down the sink
But go ahead cause my rap's made of brick
And it sticks
Kicks
Hits
And uplifts
At shows, it flows but never drifts
It's too swift and moves with quickness
Top Dog again and you say what is this
It's the under rated MC on top
The young six foot one Kid Rock
Look at the black man, now what's up
He's not a skin head, that's the Abdul Jabar Cut

Okay... Yeah
Get down
Come back
The black man from New Jersey

I think you might like to hear something from us

Stand up
Put your hands up
Come on get up
Kid Rock's in the house yo, Ready to pick up
The tempo and you know in so I will fo somewhat unconventional
But comprehendible
I'm the presentable the good lookin'
The Mello Yellow young fellow and I'm cookin
Heatin the house up just like a hot plate
Smooth on the groove like an ice skate
You didn't think in a blink I'd stand here
But now you're in fear and stand clear
You can't come near this hot stylin
Groove by the kid who's smooth as a violin
Also the perfect lyric announcer
On the set with a cold forty ouncer
Ready to glide from side to side
Why, 'cause I Step In Stride

These are the criteria I believe should be applied
'Cause I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

N-N-Now yes I'm new
But before I'm through
Your gonna see I paddle my own canoe
'Cause I'm solo
A young pro on the go
Close to an angel
But I wear no Halo
I just shake, create, and never act fake
And I learned to dislike and not hate
Because hatred leads to an uproar
Violence is one thing I am not here for
I'm just here flat out and to blow the roof
Kick some watts and that's what I inted to do
Pump it up like an air comb presser
Teach to each like a wise professor
No job I strive to reach high
Make the girls in the house all sigh
And I'll glide from side to side
Why, 'cause I Step in Stride

These are the criteria I believe should be applied
I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied

Applied, Step in Stride you bet I do
Get you high like a bottle of German Brew
Comin' clean
New on the scene
Makin' girls scream if you know what I mean
'Cause they dream of me to rock the place
And put a big smile upon their face
Any girl of any race
But they have to like the b-b-bass
And that's the rep I've earned and kept on the set
Workin up a sweat
No Jive Kid Rock uparrivd
And I Step in Stride

These are the criteria I believe should be applied
I step in stride
These are the criteria I believe should be applied
Thee... Thee... Thee... Thee
These are the criteria
Thee... Thee... Thee... Thee
These are the criteria I believe should be applied Applied... applied... applied... applied
Applied... plied... plied... plied

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

White boy get ready to do his thing's here
Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh

Here's a new jam for you to cling to
A funky rhythm that you can swing to
Kid Rock that's me
And the party jumpin' is what I'm for seeing
So just chill or I'll boot you
Get on me and I'll shoot you
I'm fresh to that there's no guessin
Rock the mic without any fessin
With your blessin
I will get stupid, you didn't know it
I thought you knew it
I'm the kid that comes exactin
With my ace the black man
To B Boys from the Midwest
Rock the shows cause were professionals
On the set night and day while the girls say

Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

The bass drops and works its hardest
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist
Clockin paper 'cause I got soul
Comin' at you from the Motor capital
Shakin booties
Not all the cuties
I'm too cool to be a little fruity
Drinkin' forties every weekend
I'm the master who's always speakin'
To some freak and if I freak her
It's at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper
But off that topic got to get it
Super dope, extremely poetic
The K-I-D-R-O-C-Kin
I love girls that's how its layin
With these jammies
Fuck the grammies
All I care about is shaking fannies
And I have been doin' it for a long time
But now I'm nineteen
And in my prime
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say

Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

On the mic is solo
'Cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos
Only rappin' 'cause I don't sing dope
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo
Lace up the Reebox
Comb the high top
Black dose with a little hip hop
And I style it with some uniqueness
You say I'm not fresh
But I could careless
One of a kind
When I rock the mic
And I'm the one that your girl is likin
Picture the girless women not lookin'
Create a beat that is fully hookin
'Cause when I get dumb
People have fun
Sisco save me the magnum
In a hell of a show I always display
While the girls say
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round
Upside Down
Can't you turn me inside out
And round and round

Ooh... oh
Upside Kid Rock, Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
He's on the upside
Get down Kid Rock
On the Upside
Upsideeeeeeeee
Upside get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Get down Kid Rock
Your on the Upside
Upside

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Non-commercial lyrics run like Hershel
Walkin' fast 'cause I'm a smooth talker
Appeal the feel, but don't praise and kneel
Just heal
And always look for the seal that's real
Top Dog, lookin' up to say what is this
Kid Rock serious and I mean business
Ascending up and up I keep boosting
Makin' hit records like Whitney Houston
With a mind of violence, right, I might
Blow the show teachers speakin' yo, I cut MP's
To release to each and be friends of
Every single, individual

Everybody all over the world, it's time for understandin
Come together

Jumbo, yo that's how I'm movin
I'm the new kid in, here's what I'm givin'
A jammed, slammin', command that take authority
Cause too many MC's appear apsrt of me
Name and they claim me, yo, that they're winnin'
A lotta just came in, sound the same in
Thinkin' they swift and can get with these young men
But I keep the crowd swingin' like Tarzan
'Cause I'm a wise man here to teach and speak
And if you step out of line your up shits creek
So come with it, Kid Rock's gonna get it
His style ain't dope, it's a throat, and I slit it
I'm raw like cowhide, smooth like a plane ride
No half steppin, I always take a full stride
Who came played and they say I'm concrete made
I used to come correct in the projects
New Port, Oxford, deep in the basement
House and parties like real estate agent
So on, so strong, and everyone got along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together

Now as I said my prayers through the years I shed a few tears
'Cause it's unjust when I see my peers get shot
And dropped and forgot, now that's hot
Too many can't score as victims of a drug war
Cocaines ran and weapons are shipped out
The press finds out, then the public is tripped out
New tax the acts and half the drug industry
Uncle Sam is my man, are you kiddin me
Me in the Whitehouse, now that's fucked up
For one to get over, one must get stuck up
One will roll up, another will smoke up
Two more thrown in jail, who picks the toll up
Tell her to beware if she's gonna stand there
Eyes bugged out and hands in the air
Cause there comes an onlooker, lookin' for a hooker
And act like the doors overlooked her and took her
For a place to hide and when he got his ride
He let the nice slide and the girl, she died
Her family cried over this homicide
And why they pondered, why she wandered
Left her own spot, her home, her mom and pop
All to smoke a little cooked up rock
So on and so strong, she couldn't get along
Knowledge is power, and there's a point to this song

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together

From the outskirts with a mind like Albert Einstein
Maybe I'm ahead of my time
Imaginate, create, spectate, elevate from the states
Surrounded by the Great Lakes
I was once out cold at 15 years old
Rolled and sold, you, me, and Bo
Sittin' in Jackson infested with rats
With a silver gat tucked deep in my slacks
I was a young bad mother in my own eyes
But now I realize it wasn't too wise
So now I teach, I'll reach to each
And every single individual

Everybody all over the world, its time for understandin
Come together
Come together
Come together
Come... come... come... come together

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

People like the way my style is rollin'
The crowd rebounds as I flow slowin
I'm not bullshittin
Heres how I'm hittin
Funkin it up more than George Clinton
Swingin', and bringin' in a new format
A new breed indeed and I'm sure of that
I'll impress the best, I won't rest the best
'Cause I'm blessed and I just won't settle for less
Yes the kid who gets the crowd up
The one with the hair that stands straight up
People look and stare in shock

Trippin' over a Rock
Trippin' over a Rock

Chased and chased and chased, but never close to caught
And the skills I filled were all self taught
With so many styles on each panfulls
And they hit ya like a fifth a jack daniels
As the girls admire the way I aspire
To move higher and build my own empire
Not a liar, I tell no lies
So hey girl you can trust these blue eyes
But don't get me wrong I get wicked
Shake that ass in my face and I'll stick it
Hit it, get wit it
Knock it out the box

Trippin' over a rock
Trippin' over a rock

A genuine badman
Like Yosemite Sam man
I c-c-c-can rock the land
And bring a new swing and sensation
To represent the next generation
So slack up, you better back up
Come the score and you leave in a jigsaw
Fuck with me
With no doubt
I'll put my foot in your ass and won't pull it out
I'll go deep in I won't weaken
Guarenteed to keep the house leapin
Girls flockin guys
Try to to cockblock

Cause everybody's Trippin' Over A Rock

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I had a realization of God, I saw God And umm,
Its not a face or a figure or anything It was a presence,
Umm the woods (all natural) God is all natural The sun,
The universe, everything You, me were part of God,
Were part of God It was an incredible feeling
And to use acid is religious for me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Kid rock that's right you know I'm back ho
From the dead where I had to lay low
Seems strange but I ain't changed nothing
Pot smokin' beer drinkin' mother fucker that's me
In the flesh and I guess I'm the best
In the muther fuckin' midwest 'cause there's no contest
For the pimp in the pimp of the nation
So fuck college and a good education
All we need to learn is how to hold hands
Then we could live in peace in my homeland
God damn the way my pain swells
I spend all my time killin' brain cells
The light shed on me was a dim gleam
So I live life in a bottle of Jim Beam
Droppin' dots or sniffin' that blow black,
I go to sleep at night watchin' Kojak
Fuck hoes 'cause I'm no big fag
Roll with Zig Zags like to read skin mags
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the bass I'd probably pluck it like this...
People wanna know what I'm thinkin' but I don't care
So I keep my thoughts in a bottle of Cuervo
Just a wild young buck
Got banned from the shelter but I really don't give a fuck
'Cause I still be clownin' suckers be frownin'
Forties of Busch I be poundin'
I ain't dead in the head like Manson
I'm more laid back than muther fuckin' Ted Danson
Hanson brother style when I'm rumblin'
Couple of shots of Don Q and I be stumblin'
Fumblin' footballs hangin' in the pool halls
Out late night with my crew stealin' U-hauls
I'm not into havin' clean fun
I step into the party strapped with a machine gun
But I'm no gangster like Gotti
"I'm just an M.C. to put the boogie in the party"
Back in black plus a new track
And I won't quit till your ears blow from feedback
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the guitar I'd probably strum it like this...
So give it up bitch 'cause I'm the kid rock
And today I know you don't wanna get shot
You look gay you're too cliche
So fuck all y'all hoes and yo Chuck pass the jay
Sellin' me out like bitches to make a quick buck
But muther fuckers like y'all just have no luck
Your little plan was a flop
Tryin' to get 'em on by sellin out the Kid Rock
A part of me was with you but yo he died,
And I'm glad you stepped off 'cause I ain't givin' no free rides
You little bald headed peon
And fuck it mother fucker if you want it let's get the beef on
'Cause I'm sure I'm sure ya
Are gonna try to come back around but I'll ignore ya
It only takes one shot to floor ya
'Cause I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm real mutha for ya
Better jet so 'cause I won't let no hoes from the metro
Take mine "what up doe"
Come look son I'm number one...
"'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done"
In the twilight zone with Rod Serling
I ain't goin' bald so fuck Sy Sperling
When I shoot I never miss
And if I played the harmonica I'd probably blow it like this...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

'Cause growin' up I was never
The logical one
Packed my shit and left home
Like the prodigal son
With a bottle of jack
And my shotgun strapped
I went looking for fame
And yo I've never been back

Filled with spite
Staying high as a kite
I was dealing and stealing
Everything in sight
Pool hustling
Trying to make that green
I've been ramblin and gamblin
Since the age of 13

Working like a bitch
Like a god damn tank
Some disagree because
My rents had bank
But all that's gold
Don't always glitter
So I'll take another puff
From my one hitter

I'm a slave to the trade
I'm paid to rhyme
Blow all my cash
On cheap women and wine
'Cause money, money, money
Ain't shit to me
But I gotta make a lot
Just to be free

I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

Please God please
I'll pay any cost
If you'd just stop the world
'Cause I wanna get off
There's too much hardship
There's too much pain
There's too many motherfuckers
Tryin' to get in my brain

I've been to your mountains
I've been to your seaside
And everywhere I went
Somebody's wanted a free ride
But parasites can't fake the Rock
And any suckers that step in my way are getting shot

'Cause I hold key
To my own success
And suckers that step
Shall be put to rest
I hold the key
To my own success
And suckers that step
Will catch a bullet in their chest

So pass the buddha
The funky tie hooter
And watch me rip
Because I'm such a slick shooter
Not a generic dime-
A-dozen M.C.
Never was in a posse
Never wanted to be

I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock, ho and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

Now I've been walking the earth
Since the beginning of time
And won't leave till
I've received that 7th sign
All this talk
Their gonna drop the bomb
But life keeps going
On and on and on and on

The world's end
Don't worry me
And I'm gonna get where I'm going
Just don't hurry me
'Cause I'm in no rush
And I can't stand rushin
Everything is slow motion
Like I'm trippin' on tussin'

Fussin with the girls
They waste my time
Thrashin and bashin
Going out of my mind
Crucified by the critics
Everyday
'Cause I really ain't got
That much to say

I'm a slave to the trade
I'm paid to rhyme
I don't wear a watch
And I don't keep time
I live my life
Just like the skipper
But only at night
Because I'm a day tripper

Twitchin, shakin
And I get more bass
Then John Paul Jones
Visions of red shoot through my head
And I won't stop trippin'
Till the day I'm dead

I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock bitch and I'm everywhere
I'm here and I'm there
I'm Kid Rock hoe and I'm everywhere

Many nights she comes to me and fills me where I lay
I hope to god one day she gonna see that love is not that way
She holds in that morning time and never lets me go
I hold on back one day she gonna see and come into my show

Yeah... Yeah... Yeah on down
Hey... hey, hey... hey, hey, hey, hey
On down, on down, on down, down, down, down, down
Well, well, well, well
Hey heeeeeeeeeey
Yeah your fuckin' with the Kid Rock honey
Get back on the streets and get my money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Get my money
Yeah you fuckin' with the Kid Rock baby
You can have my car if it will drive you crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Yeah your fuckin' with the Kid Rock honey
Get back on the streets and get my money
Yeah you fuckin' with the Kid Rock baby
You can have my car if it will drive you crazy

Have you ever known a free lancer
Thinks that he's a camper
Known around my way as the cramper
Like P.M.S. always pokin'

But he won't go away with a little Motrin
Now if you ever heard the term cramper and you wonder
The worms kinda like I guess a modern day Felix Unger
When ya first meet 'em ya think he's O.K

But then you learn a little bit of the cramper goes a long way
Hear say here I say through the grapevine
He squawks and he gawks and he walks a thin line
Just like a little fuckin' fag

He always wants to get high but never has a bag
Never works says he can't find the right job
Ain't got a dime and when he does he's a tightwad
He's the dampest there's no one damp

Huh huh... he's the mother fuckin' cramper
Now the crampers red, there's no one redder
He rides ya wrong like a really tight sweater
He's sorta like a mouse a pest of a peer

You come home he's at your house drinkin' your last beer
Pokin' and strokin' he makes you want to belt him
Always wearin' out his mother fuckin' welcome
And then sporty's never that cautious

He sips from your forty and he always backwashes
Talk about a certain subject, he'll jinx it
Let him borrow a shirt, the stooge always shrinks it
He's the dampest, there's no one damper

Huh huh... he's the mother fuckin' cramper

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I trip I rip and though I think I'm slick
I'm nothin' but a funky country hick
But I still get down with a sound that pumps
And you can hear me from the trucks and the trunks that bump
Never been questioned by the F.B.I
Although I've tried every method just to get high
L.S.D. is what I'm trippin' on
And O.E. bitch is what I'm sippin on
A big fat booty's what I'm grippin on
But for now I'm gonna rock and keep rippin on
Down to the muther fuckin' A.M.
As I co bump and jump and keep the crowd in mayhem
No brain no pain... Now c'mon y'all and tell me what's my name

Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come On, Come On
What's My Name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Sing that shit
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uh I said what's my name?
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Now break it down like this

3 sheets 2 the wind is the state I'm in
Half off the wagon with my feet draggin
Taggin hoes gettin' lots of trim
Gettin' jocks and props for all the spots I rock
I'm true I'm blue like Captain Kangaroo
And for the few who knew yo I'm a bang for you
Because the Kid Rock ain't no bitch yo
And I ain't no radio wanna get rich ho
So count my props you can't get with me
And fuck all you cops you ain't shit to me
But hoes with guns playin' hard for fun
So stay off my dick because I ain't the one
For anyone tryin' to bust
And I show no shame 'cause I'm down for mine
Now tell me what's my name

Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on bitch
What's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Come on, come on
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Uh I said what's my name
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock Rock
Kid Rock

I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed on all that is forsaken
I'm gonna get you
I see through you
I'm gonna get you

I'm like a train I roll hard, lettin' off much steam
In the Carhart flannel and dusty jeans baby
I never was cool with James Dean
But I be hanging tough with my man Jim Beam
I swing low like a chimp
Back in '86 man I was seein' a shrink
But now I'm humble and I can only think
About New Orleans and those jumbo shrimp
So ask no questions and I'll tell no lies
I got big ol' pupils and blood shot eyes
I'm on the brink if you know what I mean
And a 12 step program couldn't keep me clean
'Cause I'm the bullgod, you understand
The illegitimate son of man
The T O P to the D O G
Or the P O T to the G O D

And I'm trippin'
Said I'm trippin'

I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed on all that is forsaken
I'm gonna get you
I see through you
I'm gonna get you

A lot of people poke fun and that's all right
But when I start pokin' back they get all uptight
You can't cap with the master son
So sit your ass down before I blast you one
'Cause I'm so greasy you can call me mud
And I feel a little Hank runnin' through my blood
I wanna flood the world with my twisted thoughts
You can bet all day but I can't be bought
Uh Break it up let's tie one on
I gotta get set to go and cut the lawn
So I grab my walkman but before I cut
I got behind the garage and fire it up
'Cause I'm the bullgod, you understand
The illegitimate son of man
The T O P to the D O G
Or the P O T to the G O D

And I'm trippin'
Said I'm trippin'
And you know...

I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed on all that is forsaken
Forsaken, yeah!

You ain't nothing

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come on get 'em up
Come on get 'em up
Come on get 'em up

I am the bullgod
I am free
And I feed (yeah, yeah, yeah) on all that is forsaken
I am the bullgod (yeah...)
I am free
And I feed on all that is...

I get a feeling of peace, from a low so high
As I sit in my chair and watch life go by
These thoughts I have can't mold to sense
Through the forest of my mind, they're all past tense
Born and raised in the outer lands
And at times you can say I'm outta hand
I'm in a band of gypsies, we're on the run
Every time that paper hits my tongue
And sometimes it seems so odd
When my veins are popping and I'm on the nod
I am the bullgod, you understand
And here in my head is my master plan

Uh, I'm gonna get you
I see through you
I'm gonna get you
I see through you!

Back in the muther fuckin' saddle
My six shooter strapped and I'm lookin' for a battle
Out on the plains I'm just a loner
My saddle horn rubs right and yo it's givin' me a boner
I got thoughts of Annie Oakley
But that buck toothed tramp in that last town she broke me
And we didn't even fuck
I gave my last gold tooth 'n' gold nugget to get my dick sucked
3 days out on the frontier
And I'd kill for a cheap whore and a barrel of cold beer
I need a slut for a service
I take a peak at the shiip and they all run away nervous
Man I gotta get my rocks off
'Cause my Wranglers don't fit right unless my cock's soft
Long nights by the fire me a Trigger... go figure
(Chorus) I'm a desperate rado
Didn't take any practice
A desperate rado
Got a cock like a cactus
Now I drift through the desert like a wild coyote
Horny as a toad trippin' off peyote
Holdin' uptrains and gettin' goods by the sack
I'm known through out the west as the pie eyed mack
And to the law I'm no stranger
I'm wanted dead or alive 'cause I shot the Lone Ranger
And then Tonto tried to get down
So I boned his bitch slit hes throat and then I skipped town
That's the way I run my show
Paint towns red
Fuck hoes and then I lay low
I know you think I'm archaic
But my dick's like a sword
I see pussy and wanna slay it
Out on the plains it gets linely
Sometimes I feel homely
New faces
New towns no one knows me
Guns cocked in my holster
U see my face in each town nailed to a pole on a poster
I'm always lookin' for the quick buck
Then always blowin' my cash on a bitch with a big butt
Some say my head's hollow
Fuck em... I'm just a
(Chorus II) Desperate rado
Trottin through the bad lands
A desperate rado
Tokin down with all the cowhands
A desperate rado
Didn't take much practice
A desperate rado
Got a cock like a cactus
Now I fuck whores by the scores up ten fold on any fellow
In any town I can be found at the local bordello
Never yellow never chicken listen for my spurs draggin,
And when I'm kickin dust you better circle up the wagons
So when I rip through your town don't be gawkin
Just tip your hat and Tex keep walkin'
'Cause I'm a gun slingin top hand
Fuck with me and you'll go out like Custer at his last stand
I'm a low down buckaroo
If you leave me alone with your mother then I'll fuck her too
'Cause I'm a sidewinding nomad
And morals in upbringing is something that I never had
Known as the ruff ridin' Texan
A bad buck from the day of my inception.
And I was raised in the poor house
My mother kicked me out so she could start a whore house
Now since the day I left the corral
I've been on a quest for the plant that's called mescal
'Cause pale rider once pulled me aside
And told me that high was the best way to ride...
(Chorus III) Now I'm a desperate rado
Always lookin' for a fight
A desperate rado
Puffin on a peace pipe
I'm a desperate rado
On the run from the law
A desperate rado baddest one you ever saw

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Back from the dead second l.p. here we go
Comin' at ya from the r.o.m.e.o.
Pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys
Hat turned back in some airwalk jimmys
Never slackin' hoes I be mackin
Not wacked I don't try to act black when
I came up I came at ya from the outskirts
Bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt
Bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone
Hit bound from the mo-town allen
Fuck a 40 I drink it by the gallon
I started out in mount clemens as a d.j.
Park parties gettin' drunk on Sunday
Tweeked in the heat 2 a beat I'd rock 2 the -and rip shit up
An now I've toured this nation
Pimp of the nation
Pullin hoes
Rock the set in each city then step
Me, blackman and funk daddy def stef
Bitches, they think I'm sexist
But all I want baby is your grits for breakfast
Eggs, bacon, home cooked fries
And gimme a plate of that pussy on the side
Triple x on the set showin no class
Just a foul mouthed little fuckin' smart ass
No fool I went 2 high school dumb ass
Smoked dope and I flunked every class
Slash and I smash 'cause I thrash when I bash


Invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed
An outcast sick of being harassed so I dashed
Moved out of the crib 'cause I hated cuttin' grass
Now I reside on the eastside lovin' it
Cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it
Flex, sex, run of the next
Flippin and trippin' and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2
Front an get around 2 the
2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme
I'm shakin and takin' and breakin I rip the mic like
Every time fuck I don't eat no manwich
Kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich
Somebody said I'm the best in the mo-town
But this town ain't shit but a ghost town
Who ever said it they lied they fessed
Bitch I'm the best in the mother fuckin' midwest
Wanna be heard when I rap so I yell it
Sport a tigers cap like my man tom selleck
One bad bitch I smoke hash from a stick
Got more cash than fuckin' white boy rick
My first LP wasn't pushed for shit
So jive records yo, go and suck a fat dick
'Cause I'm rippin like a chainsaw
Yes I'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like hee haw
Roll it up, take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down gratiot
In my grand marquis I pimp to the beat
Two in the front and two hoes in the back seat

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
I've been livin' a lie so long it seems I've lived a life time
If you could see what I feel it would make your ghetto look like heaven
And I believe it stems down from my family situation
I never liked my old man
I couldn't stand to be around him
Sometimes I sit all alone just starin' at his picture, yeah
My heart turns to stone and I think of this

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
You never loved me, you never held me tight
Instead you shook me like a beast to wake me up at night
You tried to make me think that your ways were best
When all I was was an outlet for all your stress

Life it's the ultimate sin
A game with no rules that you're expected to win
My personal hell's hidden with a grin
Dad take the stand and let the trial begin
You said that oil and water don't mix though it seems cool
Keep with your own and don't fuck up our gene pool
UYoushould've went to school like your bigger brother
But you played the fool with a different color
Runnin' ship with a whip
I tried to keep up but I kept getting tripped
Money made you so wise
How could you look through my face and not see your own eyes
Do as I say and not as I do
But I can't 'cause when I look in the mirror I see you
And oh the pain how it hurts
It was always your home and your business that came first
You said a man is as good as his word
But your mind was closed and mine never heard
My visions blurred, thoughts obscured
And with my blinders down I strain from the heard
They say the nut don't fall far from the tree
Look at you then look at me...

You ain't nothin' to me you've never been to me
And all you ever gave a fuck about was money see
So now fuck you man you ain't shit to me
And it's the day that I die of this hate that I'm free

Now I know growin' up son that it ain't always been easy
And I know at times I was not always there for you
No we never spent much time just talkin' or havin' a good time
But understand growin' up son I never had a dime
So I worked my ass off and I put myself through college
And everything I have to this day you know I built it all
Oh I wish I could go back and change the years that's lost between us
I wish I could take back some of the things I said to you
Son I said I'm sorry but still you resent me so
Son I said I'm sorry and why do you resent me so

I always loved you I always cared for you
Just never wanted you to go through what I've been through
I tried to raise my fuckin' family just the best I know
And now I'm hated like the devil and for why I don't know
Dah

All right, get down baby
Yeah

I need somebody won't you help me
I need somebody won't you tell me who I am
I need somebody please, please help me
I need somebody you must tell me who I am

Hey, hey, hey
Tell me who I am
Hey, hey
Tell me who I am
I am, I am
Tell me who I am, am, am
Tell meeeee
Tell meeeee

(A Minute Or So After The Song Is Over...)
If it looks good, you'll see it.
If it sounds good, you'll hear it.
If it's marketed right, you'll buy it.
But... if it's real, you'll feel it.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Cruisin through town in my jacked up truck
Eyes open 'cause I'm scopin for a big butt slut
One that I can take straight back to my house
And that will suck my dick and put my balls in her mouth
Now get get with it look across the street
I seen a skinny in a skirt boppin to the beat
So I gapped up my 40 stuck it under my seat
Rolled up on the freak and I started to speak
But before I could talk, she goes and grabbed my dick
Licked her lips and started talkin' that porno shit
She said look here I know you're kid rock
Then whispered in my ear ("I wana swallow your cock")
Well blow me up and then blow me down
'Cause I think I just found the biggest freak in town
And now I can't wait to get her back to my house
Set her on her knees and put my balls in her mouth

Balls in your mouth
Ballls in your mouth
(You want my balls in your mouth) 2x

Went back to my crib with no delay
Big grin on my gril with not much to say
Except hey yo bitch how's about
I drop my drawers and put my balls in your mouth
Then it was like straight audible porn
She dropped to her knees and started blowin' my horn (horn blows)
And after that, without a doubt
She opened up wide and put my balls in her mouth
Next the cutie started rubbin my back
And she put her finger right between my bootie and crack
So I grabbed her wrist quick and said hold up slut
"Ain't nobody stickin nuttin in my butt"
Now right then I knew I had a hoe and a half
And all that I could do was sit back and laugh
Stare at the ceilin thinkin' about
This chick I just met's got my balls in her mouth

Balls in your mouth
Balllls in your mouth
(You want my balls in your mouth)
2x

After I busted my nuts I drove her to the cut
She said ("i hope you don't think that I'm a big slut...
...And please don't tell anyone wat we've been through")
The next day I told the whole fuckin' crew
Spread the news to the whole damn town
And to that chick, it musta got back around
So I told the hoe sorry and tried to make our mends
But she tried to front me in front of my friends
Runnin' off with her lip talkin' all that shit
That I'm a bitch I'm a prick and that I gotta small dick
I just waited till she walked away to shout
Fuck you bitch you had my balls in your mouth!

Balls in your mouth
Ballls in your mouth
(You want my balls in your mouth)
2x

Hey Kid Rock, tell 'em how your livin'
Man I spend my birthdays at Denny's eatin southern slams
I'm not a butt nut you know that I never bang
But I lick more coochie than K.D. Lang
But I'm not gonna kick an X-rated rap
And even if I did you know that you couldn't fade it black
Cause my rap's like gold, or precious gems
While your rap's like an 8th full of beeners and stems
Kid Rock I love to sing
Call me the king of pain, but my name ain't Sting
Or Roger Clinton, I'm not riding off my brothers fame
Cause all you sap suckers don't even know my brothers name
Bill Ritchie he lives in Chicago
He rides through town in an Eldorado
Maldo black, real white so I'm lookin'
And I gotta give it up to my homies in Brooklyn
Romeo Mt. Clemens to Metro Beat
From Huston, to L.A., back to Stoney Creek
Like I said, roll it up take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down grass shit
It's guaranteed every time we get hoe's
I play on my guitar, puff loud through my big nose
You'll never see me in Thyland
But you can catch Kid Rock on a hot day rollin' on the island

Yeah Wes your still my man so
Get on the mic and do the best ya can
Oh yes, yes y'all, yes y'all, and ya don't stop
Oh yes, yes y'all, yes y'all, and ya don't quit
Oh yes, yes y'all, yes y'all, and ya don't stop
Come on Wes, give 'em what ya got
Give me the mic and I'ma wreck ya from the start to end
But gimme brew and gimme that and I'ma do you in
You talkin' trash, I smoke that ass so fast you wouldn't know
What hit you bro, so here I got you thought I couldn't flow
To a track laid back by Kid Rock G
Now even white bitches in the subberbs they jock me
With a smile pow wow they want this getto thing
So pow wow freaky chow, and ima let it hang
Born and raised in the E.D. so I'ma let cha know
Is that wrong I stand strong and I'ma getto bro
Crew yo, I thought you knew when I'd be rollin' deep
No fuckin' Nytol needed to put your ass to sleep
I fly heads where there's dreads with the curly do
I screw hoe's from Shamiqua down to curly Sue
You think I'm jokin, I'm pokin your girl, she lovin' me
Sugar walls to my balls that how I'm shovin it
Wham bam thank you mam a dirty nigger wrote
And if your man wanna trip I'll let the trigger go
Pop, pop, pop, pop, now watch that nigger drop
There goes my girl, yell the phone somebody call the cops
When they come I'm gonna run outta my fuckin' steals
And watch them hoe's in the flow like they was Johnny Gill
Want a real deal with 2 gettin' wild bucks wallet
That's how we do it when were rollin' on the island

Now Prince Vince I remember hangin' in your hood
With the 40's, hoe's, do I make myself understood?
Yeah, I put you on them black hoes
They used to like your white ass, your blue eyes and your pionty nose
Yeah we poked hoe's in heards (word)
Then I took your black ass out to the subberbes
People don't know about you and me (or unity)
Ain't it funny how were still down in 93
Don't let me catch them slimmys when you roll 'em through
'Cause if you do then ima hafta choose the weapon that I gotta use
And light my infared dead on that forehead
Woof, woof, woff mother fucker now your left in red
Your runnin' around with a string of chicks
Now nigger you don't wanna see me or the K to the I to the mother fuckin' D
Straight G's from the streets
I'm droppin' your lyrics on your best Kid Rock beat
Now ima kick ya like this and like that
I'm kickin a funky track with Kid Rock because we go way back
Back in the day's to the late 80's
When I dropped the gang stuff, drunk, and dirty young niggers
Crazy, but now were kickin it in the 90's
And Cruew St. is where the niggers were frontin
Just coolin with my buds, slangin shit late at night
But the jealous niggers trying to tell us
Slangin ain't the way to get paid
But fuck the bullshit all I'm thinkin' about is ponytail
I gotta get made, I got a pocket full of lint
Too much late former rate, and I gotta rest it
Shit the hookers, the hoe's the takers, the pros
A nickel plated nina ready to explode
On any nigger tryin' to jack, rat-a-tat-tat
Put his ass on his back for the comosat
Now can I keep my style and get wild?
Me, Kid Rock and Wes Chill, just coolin on the island
It's like this and like that
I told you mother fuckers better pack your back

I got my Harley on the highway revvin
If a whip-it was a nipple I'd be lost in heaven
I'm rollin' straight 7 so what up?
Like Bush Wisk said you play pussy get fucked, your outta luck
'Cause I'm the best mother fucker from this time
For breakfast I snort cocaine and eat pork rines
Shockin signs is what I'm sowin
I'm the hoe and I'm knowin' the mind blowin' home growin'
In my back yard, lyin' in the sun you know I fry quick
Gettin' lit when I be smokin' that tye stick
Cause that's what the Kids all about
I like rollin' up on hoes and screamin balls in your mouth
From South Alabama, North Montana, I'm smokin' and
Chackin cause you know I am a
Little long haired high on, and you can find Kid Rock
In the gutter on the mother fuckin' island

You know how it is
Some guys just gotta make time to get their rocks off no matter what
I'm like that
Tearin up pussy every where I go
I'm Kid mother fuckin' Rock so what's up hoe?
You wanna get fucked by me dick mick dangles
Then drop your funky drawers straight down to your ancles
And swing that big ass in my direction
For a little safe sex for the inspection
Cause though I'm mackin hoe's like Jyro Mackson
I'm learnin real quick gotta wrap my johnson
But just insace I hope your on the pill
'Cause I been known to ride a pussy like bad boy Bill
And I hate to spill, or raise the stakes
And nutin all up in your shit if my rubber breaks
Now my dick rocks when I'm lickin' all that gin
So spread your phony legs and let the games begin
Wait, hold up bitch, say what's with the bad cough
I see ya right away, I think I'm gonna go jack off

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Dum diti dum dang dang di dum
2 bums in an alley with a bottle of rum
1 bum said look Jack I'm the shit
Put his knees to his ears and sucked his own dick
My mothers crazy I think she sniffs glue
She never liked me and I know that's true
Kicked me out the crib becuz I got a tattoo
No one loves me and no one cares
And all I ever get is funny stares
I can't help it if I'm nothin' but a wino
So I hang at the zoo chillin' with the rhinos
Stealin' bottles of booze outta A &amp; P
I know a girl at Denny's and I always eat free
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper
For Christmas I bought the old man the Clapper
I'm so dapper you can call me Dan
But they call me round eye when I'm chilin in Japan
Got a bad ass bitch and she ain't no dike
But fuck that ho and let me tell ya what I like
I like bean burritos from Taco Bell
I like trippin' on acid with Dick Vitale
My hair ain't plastic and my clothes aren't clashin'
I write my rhymes on a schooner in a 90's fashion
Took too many many trip and now I can's stop trippin'
My mellow D. killed a rat in the kitchen
U think you toke tuff I'd disagree
Nobody blows more doobs than Richard D.
I get ill on hoes who I know ain't fertile
I'm a real jet setter like Cecil turtle
I'm down with Bill Bands so Fuck Joe Glover
And while I'm at it muther fuck fat ass Sally Struthers
U look fine girl kinda undercover
But I can't fuck ya 'cause you look like my mother
I said dang digee dang di dang dang
It ain't Eric Estrada or Kool and The Gang
U know I hand in the Clem chillin' on the strip
With all them mother fuckers who slang that shit
U know I'm a pimp hold my dick like a holster
U sing it "all the girls want a kid rock poster"
Lifes a big joke and that's how it strikes me
But fuck it 'cause I know "Somebody up there likes me."
Assholes are only assholes, fo sho'

Smokin' any thing that I can fit in a pipe
Slammin' bottles of tussin and going fishing for pike
Never uptight my high won't permit it
My problem's life but I don't sweat it, just live it
And I'm not your average rapper
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper
So bitch better watch your back
'Cause I push more power than a Marshall stack
Never the wack but oh so pesky
Some say I can't flow but muther fucker don't test me
And if you arrest me you dumb cop
I'll find your daughter and I'll give her this cock
Kid Rock's my mother fuckin' name
Bitch you know me so pass the O.E.
And don't talk about takin' me out
'Cause I got your girl and I'm makin' her shout
Just like a piano I'm really grand
And I got more riffs than Steely Dan
Some friends call me fly
But most just call me when they wanna get high
It ain't the disco Cisco Kid muther fucker
It's the outlasting shotgun-blasting
Dick-swingin' pussy lickin' punk
Little skinny muther fucker and I'm not no hunk
But I got more rhymes than a cornfield stalks
And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk
Walk with a limp 'cause I pimp like a pro
And if ya dis me punk I'll fuck your ho
And though you think I'm nothing more than a young punk
I'm like a hound dog chasin a chipmunk
I move quick like a cheetah
And it ain't shit to me to just beat a
M.C. down who looks like a dick
Jumpin' 'round like a homo on a pogo stick
Yo rock, What's up stop being a jerk
And just "Give 'em an example of how a D.J. works"
'Cause it's blackjack and I got two aces
Been many places seen many faces
And everywhere I go people wanna jive
So I keep my fingers on my .45
So don't cross my dusty path
Or I'll put my foot up in crusty ass
Don't front ho pass the jay
Then hear me M.C. and watch me D.J.
To the beat y'all and I won't stop
And I'ma rock this shit till your eardrums pop
Everybody's tryin' to get a piece of the pie
But I don't let bullshit spoil my high

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

A bottle of jack's got my manager grinnin'
Yeah that's me that keeps the turntables spinniN'
I'm countin' cards and I keep on winnin'
I know God hates me 'cause I'm always sinnin'
U don't know me blow me ho you wanna get hot
You'll get your ass blown out fuckin' with the Kid Rock
Eatin up ya suckers just the same way a beast could
Tearin through your town like muther fuckin' Clint Eastwood
'Cause I be fakin the rhymes that keep ya shakin'
Makin' a lotta money but don't let me be mistaken
I never thought about climbin up the pop chart
And I don't give a fuck you can't buy my tape in K-Mart
Give me a choice between soundin like an ass wipe
Or sittin' in an alley smokin' crack from a glass pipe
I'd be as skinny as a junkie with the AIDS plague
But still I'd look better than a puppet tryin' to get paid
Now check the rhyme as I climb and I co get rude
And send ya runnin' playin' pussy like Shaggy and Scoob
'Cause I'm the wrong dude to fuck with my mouth is mental
And I'm a tear shit up like they did in South Central
Son of a bitch I'm the son of a bitch
Nobody ever loved you so you're the son of a dick
I'm a product of a young girl top in her class
You're a product of a hooker who was sellin that ass
And your styles in the past it's old and dusty
So from now on I'm callin u M.C. Crusty
'Cause to face me you must be blitzed or blasted
So now I'm gonna drop ya like a hit of acid
And when I rip ya people they might stare
'Cause I got more rhymes than Donahue's got white hair
An yo buck won't you please be a friend
And tell your mom I wanna fuck and I'll pick her up at 10

She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her

She's got a way of pleasin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway

She's got a smile that heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me

And she's got a way of talkin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

She's got a way of showin'
Mmm-hmm, how I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'

She's got a light around her
Oh-oh, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me, I get turned around
(Oh-ohoh, oh-oh, oh-ohoh, whoa-oh)

She's got a smile it heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me

She's got a way about her
Mmm, I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her
Anyway, hey

You can make me free
You can make me smile
You can make me be
Like a little child 

You can melt the ice that chills my body 
You can dry my every tear
You make the lonely hours disappear

You can make me free 
You can make me rise 
You can make me see 
So open up my eyes 
Don't you know my only real moments 
Are the ones I spend with you 
How I long to drink some wine again with you 

I can take to the skies 
I can soar like a bird with its heart full of song 
Won't you color my eyes 
I've been waiting so long 

You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try 

And if I must wait a lonely lifetime 
Until I am with you, my love 
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of 

I can take to the skies 
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song 
Won't you cover my eyes 
I've been waiting so long 

You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try 

And if I must wait a lonely lifetime 
Until I am with you, my love 
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of 

I can take to the skies 
I can soar like a bird with his heart full of song 
Won't you cover my eyes 
I've been waiting so long 

You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better 
If you would only try 

And if I must wait a lonely lifetime
Until I am with you, my love 
I will wait but you'll be what I'm dreamin' of 

You can make me free 
You can make me cry 
You can make it so much better

Baby all the lights are turned on you 
Now you're in the center of the stage 
Everything revolves on what you do 
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age 

And you can always have your way somehow 
But everybody loves you now 

You can walk away from your mistakes 
You can turn your back on what you do 
Just a little smile is all it takes 
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too 

Loneliness will get to you somehow 
But everybody loves you now 

Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply 
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry 
So do I 

All the people want to know your name 
Soon there will be lines outside your door 
Feelings do not matter in your game 
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore 

So your life is only living anyhow 
And everybody loves you now 

Close your eyes when you don't want to see 
Stay at home when you don't want to go 
Only speak to those who will agree 
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know 

You have lost your innocence somehow 
But everybody loves you now 

Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever 
And it's all been done before 
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor 
No more 

See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl? 
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down 
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall 

This is what you wanted; ain't you proud? 
'Cause everybody loves you now

Of all the people in the world that I know 
You're the best place to go 
When I cry, when I cry 

I never asked for much before, not before 
Things are changed; I need more 
Tell me why, Judy, why? 

I never thought that she would say 
Say goodbye; but she did 
And now I wanna die. I wanna die 

I never thought that I would need, need a friend 
But I did, in the end 
Tell me why, Judy, why 

Oh, what a scene 
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way 
Oh, where you been? 
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day 

A man my age is very young, so I'm told 
Why do I feel so old? 
Tell me why, Judy, why? 
Oh, what a scene 
It's wrong for her to hang me up this way 
Oh, where you been? 
'Cause it's so hard to make it through the day 

There's no tomorrow 'cause my dreams did not last 
So I live in the past 
Tell me why, Judy, why?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream 
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
You make believe the past was just a dream 

Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 

Oh, Elisa, you must begin again 
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end 
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend 
I loved you but I thought I was your friend 

Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 

Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea 
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me 
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be 
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be 

So turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song
And I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free 

Feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face 
It's liftin' me high above my ordinary place 
And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace 

Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And who knows what your next move will be? 

Ah, you look so good to me 
With my eyes open wide, I can see 
Ah, you feel so good to me 
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I've been livin' for the moment 
But I just can't have my way 
And I'm afraid to go to sleep 
'Cause tomorrow is today 

People tell me life is sweeter 
But I don't hear what they say 
Nothing comes to change my life 
So tomorrow is today 

I don't care to know the hour 
'Cause it's passing anyway 
I don't have to see tomorrow 
'Cause I saw it yesterday 

So I listen for an answer 
But the feeling seems to stay 
And what's the use of always dreaming 
If tomorrow is today 

Still I'm waiting for the morning 
But it feels so far away 
And you don't need the love I'm giving 
So tomorrow is today 

Oh, my. Goin' to the river
Gonna take a ride and the Lord will deliver me 
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it 
If you don't come, I'm sure gonna die in it 
Too late. Too much given 
I've seen a lot of life and I'm damn sick of livin' it 
I keep hopin' that you will pass my way 

And some day if your dreams are leavin' you 
I'll still believe in you 

I don't care to know the hour 
'Cause it's passing anyway 
I don't have to see tomorrow 
'Cause I saw it yesterday 

Though I'm living and I'm singing 
And although my hands still play 
Soon enough it will all be over 
'Cause tomorrow is today

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Well so here I am at the end of the road 
Where do I go from here? 
I always figured it would be like this 
Still nothing seems to be quite clear 

All the words have been spoken and the prophecy fulfilled 
But I just can't decide where to go 
Yes, it's been quite a day and I should go to sleep 
But tomorrow I will wake up and I'll know 

That I've got to begin again 
Though I don't know how start 
Yes, I've got to begin again 
And it's hard 

Well it's been quite a while since I lifted my head 
And I'm sure the light will hurt my eyes 
I see the way that I been spendin' my days 
And reality has caught me by surprise 

I was dreamin' of tomorrow so I sacrificed today 
And it sure was a grand waste of time 
And despite all the truth that's been thrown in my face 
I just can't get you out of my mind 

That I've got to begin again 
Though I don't know how start
Yes, I've got to begin again 
And it's hard

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
And things are gonna be alright with me

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that all her dreams are sweet
Said now, would ya guide her on the roads
And make them softer for her feet

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me

Hey, Lord would ya look out for her tonight
If she is sleepin' under the sky
Said now, make sure the ground she's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry

Mmm, don'tcha give her too much rain
Try to keep her away from pain
Because my baby hates to cry

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause it gets rough along the way
Said now, this song seems strange is just because
I don't know how to pray

Mmm, won'tcha give her peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday

Hey Lord, take a look all around
And I'd a-find where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
'Cause she is far across the sea

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight
And make sure that she's gonna be alright
Until she's home and here with me
With me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin

He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"

La, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinking alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"

Oh, la, la, la, de, de, da
La, la, de, de, da, da, dum

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling all right

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
Gotta get ready to go

You say you went out late last evenin'
Did a lot of drinkin', come home stinkin'
And you went and fell asleep on the floor

And then your lady comes and finds you a sleepin'
Starts into weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'
And you better get your ass out the door

Ain't no crime
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
It ain't no crime
Well, ev'rybody gets that way sometime
It ain't no crime, oh

You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
And you gotta get ready to go

Well, now you tell me you love somebody
And you'll love 'em forever, you may love 'em forever
But you won't like 'em all of the time

Well, now you tell me you need somebody
For the rest of your life you might have somebody
But you won't want 'em every day

Ain't no crime
Well, it's just human nature, happens all the time
It ain't no crime
Well, don't think twice about gettin' it off your mind
It ain't no crime, oh

Ain't no crime,
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind
It ain't no crime
Well it's just human nature, happens all the time
It ain't no crime, oh

You got to open your eyes in the morning
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
Gotta get ready to go

And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin'
The grass keeps growin', you gotta keep goin'
And the Lord'll have mercy on your soul

Oooh, yeah, Lord, Lord
La la la la, ooh

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When you look into my eyes
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul
It always comes as a surprise
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow

Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home

When you touch my weary head
And you tell me everything will be all right
You say, "Use my body for your bed
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night"

Well, I'll never be a stranger and I'll never be alone
Whenever we're together, that's my home

Home can be the Pennsylvania Turnpike
Indiana's early morning dew
High up in the hills of California
Home is just another word for you

Well I never had a place that I could call my very own
That's all right, my love, 'cause you're my home

If I travel all my life
And I never get to stop and settle down
Long as I have you by my side
There's a roof above and good walls all around

You're my castle, you're my cabin and my instant pleasure dome
I need you in my house 'cause you're my home
You're my home

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

From a town known as Wheeling, West Virginia
Rode a boy with a six-gun in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande

Well, he started with a bank in Colorado
In the pocket of his vest, a Colt he hid
And his age and his size
Took the teller by surprise
And the word spread of Billy the Kid

Well he never travelled heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
And he never had a sweetheart
And he never had a home
But the cowboys and the ranchers knew his name

Well he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma
And the law just could not seem to track him down
And it served his legend well
For the folks they love to tell
'Bout when Billy the Kid came to town

Well, one cold day a posse captured Billy
And the judge said, "String 'im up for what he did."
And the cowboys and their kin
Like the sea came pourin' in
To watch the hangin' of Billy the Kid

Well he never travel'ed heavy
Yes, he always rode alone
And he soon put many older guns to shame
Well he never had a sweetheart
But he finally found a home
Underneath the Boot Hill grave that bears his name

From a town known as Oyster Bay, Long Island
Rode a boy with a six-pack in his hand
And his daring life of crime
Made him a legend in his time
East and West of the Rio Grande

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Today I'm livin' like a rich man's son
Tomorrow mornin', I could be a bum
It doesn't matter which direction, though
I know a woman in New Mexico

Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong, oh

And if I don't have a car, I'll hitch
I got a thumb and she's a son of a bitch
I do my writing on my road guitar
And make a living at a piano bar, oh

Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong

(Ooh) Lightning and thunder
Flashed across the roads we drove upon
Oh, but it's clear skies we're under
When I am together, when I sing the song

Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong, oh

Fun ain't easy if it ain't free
Too many people got a hold on me
But I know something that they don't know
I know a woman in New Mexico

Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong

Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong

Worse comes to worst
I'll get along
I don't know how, but sometimes
I can be strong

He always found it hard to take her
She wouldn't listen to advice
And though he never tried to make her
She often thought it would be nice

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
It's been a long time comin'
But she's feelin' like a woman tonight
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye

She tried for years to be a good wife
It never quite got off the ground
And all those stories of the good life
Convinced her not to hang around

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
And she doesn't know what's comin'
But she sure knows what she's leavin' behind
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye

And though she finds it hard to leave him
She knows it would be worse to stay
He wouldn't understand the reasons
That make a woman run away

Oh, and now she's headin' out to California
With some money in her pocket
She's a rocket on the Fourth of July
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye

She's headin' out to California
With some money in her pocket
She's a rocket on the Fourth of July
And she left a little letter
Said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada
Goodbye, goodbye

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
Though I know it wouldn't change your feelings
And I know you'll carry on the best you can

If I only had the urge to tell you
If you only knew how hard it is to say
When the simple lines have all been taken
And the radio repeats them every day

If I never find the song to sing you
If you always find it hard to comprehend
Well, you know there wouldn't be much meaning
If I had to sing those tired words again

Life goes on and on
And tonight will soon be gone
But if we try we can be sure

If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
But I only have these arms to hold you
And it's all that you can ask of any man

La la la la, la la la la

If I only had the words to tell you
If you only had the time to understand
Oh, but I only have these arms to hold you
And it's all that you can ask of any man

Well, it's a rainy night in Paris
And I'm sitting by the Seine
It's a pleasure to be soaking
In the European rain

Now my belly's full of fancy food and wine
Oh, but in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line
Oh, in the morning there'll be hell to pay
Somewhere along the line

Sweet Virginia Cigarette
Burning in my hand
Well you used to be a friend of mine
But now I understand

You've been eating up inside me for some time
Oh, and I know you're gonna get me
Somewhere along the line
And I know you're gonna get me
Somewhere along the line

Somewhere along the line
Well I know it's just a matter of time
When the fun falls through and the rent comes due
Somewhere along the line, woah

Well, you know I love my woman
And I would not let her down
And I did my share of lovin'
When I used to get around

Now I'm satisfied that she is lookin' fine
Oh, but you pay for satisfaction
Somewhere along the line
Well, you pay for your satisfaction
Somewhere along the line

Hey, it's good to be a young man
And to live the way you please
Yes, a young man is the king
Of every kingdom that he sees

There's an old and feeble man not far behind
Oh, it surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line
Well, it surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line
Well you know, it will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line, oh

Saturday night and you're still hangin' around
You're tired of livin' in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while, hmmm

So you go to the Village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile, mmm

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin', oh yeah, yeah

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait
For that call, mmm

So you stand on the corner in your new English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Oh, but still your finger's gonna pick your nose
After all, mmm, yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, you'll be smilin', oh, oh yeah, yeah

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
And what for, mmm

So, you've got everything but nothing's cool
They've just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore

But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
La da da, oh yeah, yeah

So you play your albums and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong, mmm

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well, you're twenty-one and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long, oh, oh yeah yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Oh, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will make it right tonight
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight

Once upon a time in the land of misty satin dreams
There stood a house and a man who painted nature scenes
He painted trees and fields and animals and streams and he stayed
And he didn't hear the fallin' of the rain

In the forest green lived a girl who put her hair in braids
And she sang as she walked all around the wooded glade
She was glad when the rain came falling on her face and she sang
'Cause she didn't mind the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

High upon a hill far away from all the dusty crowd is a boy
With his eyes on the ground; his head is bowed; he is a fool
And his mind is filled with hopeless dreams and he waits
But he will not see the fallin' of the rain

Will it always be the same as we recall?
Does it touch you when the rain begins to fall?
Ah, but I don't want to know and I don't want to see
Another rainy day without you lyin' next to me

So now the boy becomes the man who sits and paints all day
But the girl with the braids in her hair has gone away
And it seems that time has brought things to an end; nothing's changed
'Cause you can't stop the fallin' rain.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hey Lord, take a look all around

And things are gonna be alright with me

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight

Mmm, don'tcha give her too much rain
Try to keep her away from pain

Said now, this song seems strange is just because

And if you ever find the time
Won'tcha tell her I miss her everyday

Hey Lord, take a look all around

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight

Hey Lord, would ya look out for her tonight

She's got a way about her
I don't know what it is
But I know that I can't live without her

She's got a way of pleasin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But there doesn't have to be a reason
Anyway

She's got a smile that heals me
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But I have to laugh when she reveals me

And she's got a way of talkin'
Mmm, I don't know why it is
But it lifts me up when we are walkin'
Anywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me and I get turned around

She's got a way of showin'
Mmm-hmm, how I make her feel
And I find the strength to keep on goin'

She's got a light around her
Oh-oh, and everywhere she goes
A million dreams of love surround her
Everywhere

She comes to me when I'm feelin' down
Inspires me without a sound
She touches me, I get turned around
(Oh-ohoh, oh-oh, oh-ohoh, whoa-oh)

She's got a smile it heals me

Baby all the lights are turned on you 
Now you're in the center of the stage 
Everything revolves on what you do 
Ah, you are in your prime; you've come of age 

And you can always have your way somehow 
But everybody loves you now 

You can walk away from your mistakes 
You can turn your back on what you do 
Just a little smile is all it takes 
Yeah, you can have your cake and eat it too 

Loneliness will get to you somehow 
But everybody loves you now 

Ah, they all want your white body
And they await your reply 
Ah, but between you and me and the Staten Island ferry 
So do I 

All the people want to know your name 
Soon there will be lines outside your door 
Feelings do not matter in your game 
Yeah, 'cause nothing's gonna touch you anymore 

So your life is only living anyhow 
And everybody loves you now 

Close your eyes when you don't want to see 
Stay at home when you don't want to go 
Only speak to those who will agree 
Yeah, and close your mind when you don't want to know 

You have lost your innocence somehow 
But everybody loves you now 

Ah, you know that nothing lasts forever 
And it's all been done before 
Ah, but you ain't got the time to go to Cold Spring Harbor 
No more 

See how all the people gather 'round
Hey, isn't it a thrill to see them crawl? 
Keep your eyes ahead and don't look down 
Yeah, and lock yourself inside your sacred wall 

This is what you wanted; ain't you proud? 
'Cause everybody loves you now

Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream 
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean 
You make believe the past was just a dream 
You make believe the past was just a dream

And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 

Oh, Elisa, you must begin again 
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end 
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend 
I loved you but I thought I was your friend 

Turn around, turn around 
And I will sing for you a song 
I don't know where you been 
But you've been gone too long 

Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea 
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me 
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be 
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be 

So turn around, turn around

And I don't know where you been

Come around when you're feeling low
When you're down you can be sure
That I am the one place you can go

It's been a long long time
And you haven't made up your mind
It's been a long long day
And there isn't enough to say
It's been a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
But that's all right.

Make a call when you want to know
After all
You should be sure
That I am the one place you can go.

It's been a long long road
And we've still got a way to go
It's been a long long song
But we're gonna try rambling on
Baby
Baby
Such a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
But that's all right.

I'm heading back to where I've been
But there's a change
I can't get used to being free with you
It's strange
It's been a long (such a) long while
Now I see you smile
Nothing left to do but to let it rain

It's been a long long road
And we've still got a way to go
It's been a long long song
But we're gonna try rambling on
Baby
Baby
Such a long long night
And there isn't an end in sight
Oh
But that's all right.

I'm heading back to where I've been
But there's a change
I can't get used to being free with you
It's strange
It's been a long (such a) long while
Now I see you smile
Nothing left to do but to let it rain

Come around when you're feeling low
When you're down you can be sure
That I am the one place you can go

Make a call when you want to know
After all
You should be sure
That I am the one place you can go

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Saturday night and you're still hangin' around
You're tired of livin' in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while, hmmm

So you go to the Village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile, mmm

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin', oh yeah, yeah

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Your phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait
For that call, mmm

So you stand on the corner in your new English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Oh, but still your finger's gonna pick your nose
After all, mmm, yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, you'll be smilin', oh, oh yeah, yeah

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ah, there ain't no place to go anyway
And what for, mmm

So, you've got everything but nothing's cool
They've just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore

But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'
La da da, oh yeah, yeah

So you play your albums and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Oh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got
What went wrong, mmm

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well, you're twenty-one and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long, oh, oh yeah yeah

But Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Oh, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push and you'll be smilin'

Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, now Captain Jack will make it right tonight
Yeah, Captain Jack will get you high tonight

Didn'cha know what I mean
When I said 'I love you Josephine'? Yeah
Josephine.
Nothing I say does justice to you
Or lights up the day the way that you do
Josephine.

Like a beautifil queen
You deserve a crown
My Josephine. Yeah
Josephine.
Well
I pick up the phone and give you a call
You come around with your sneakers and all
Josephine.

Well
Sit right back. Suppose I went away. Ah
Honey.
Would your love turn sour and moldy green?
When I take from you the light of yoodle-eh-hi-hoo
Would I make you sad
My Josephine?

You arrived on the scene
You made me glad I'm alive
My Josephine. Yeah
Josephine.
Well
Nothing I say does justice to you
Lights up the day the way that you do
Josephine.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When will it come around
The wind that will inspire
When will it make a sound
The sound I desire

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true

Floating upstream I've seen
The spider and the snake
A trip without pause when
I saw my mistake

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true

All my life I have known who I am
A troubled man, but I stand
All my life I have seen what it means
To be myself in this dream

'Cause we all need something to do
A certain someone... that's you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

All I got is a black cross
And two crabs in my left eye
What you say you want you want
Like a lump in your right thigh

We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend

You the users of the wheel
Stink of oil and electric eels
Users of forbidden tools
We must be the fools

We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend

Cancel the world
Erase history
There is no future
As far as I can see

We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend
We're going left on right
And I don't want to see you again
Going left on right
And I don't wanna be your friend

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's always half and half
I'm happy and I'm sad
Everything that's beautiful
Always kills me too
The highest I get up
Is the deepest I get down
You're up there with your life
That's why I gotta shout, shout
...And then gotta shout, shout

Blues for Meister
You sweet little thing
Blues for Meister
I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up
Sittin' on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby
I really miss you now
Well have some respect
For my cat
He got squashed by the wheel
Of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy
We lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico

Your food's still in the cupboard
Hangin' in its can
You used to love to eat it
Down
I'll always love you Meister
You were so good to me
There's nothing like you nowhere
As far as I can see

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Show me a sign that I love you 
Blow me a mind as you always do 
Remind me to tell you that I've come to 
Believe in the beauty, the power of you 
Woman, dissolve into the sea 
The body of water is calling me 
The god of my daughter is always free 
There's nothing to solve and you're solving me 

Ooh, I'm in your company 
Ooh, body that's calling me 
Ooh, I'm in your company 

Throw me a line I could use one 
I special-design me 'cause I'm your son 
Two thousand below where I feel my love 
The body of water where I come from 

I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal 
Fire from the other side out there 
Formations flow like screams 

I'm made with a life to spare 
Get the jizz, Mister sism? got a rhythm 
Technology of a prayer 
Scientist to the prism of faith 
And hope so I am there 

Baby I'm old, can you come here? 
The science of love is becoming clear 
Invisible love with the color still 
I need to a place in the atmosphere 
And I may believe...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There's a port on a western bay 
And it serves a hundred ships a day 
Lonely sailors pass the time away 
And talk about their homes 

And there's a girl in this harbor town 
And she works layin' whiskey down 
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round" 
She serves them whiskey and wine 

The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea" 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

Brandy wears a braided chain 
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain 
A locket that bears the name 
Of the man that Brandy loves 

He came on a summer's day 
Bringin' gifts from far away 
But he made it clear he couldn't stay 
No harbor was his home 

The sailor saidn "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea" 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes 
When he told his sailor stories 
She could feel the ocean foam rise 
She saw its ragin' glory 

But he had always told the truth, lord, he was an honest man 
And Brandy does her best to understand 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

At night when the bars close down 
Brandy walks through a silent town 
And loves a man who's not around 
She still can hear him say 

She hears him say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 
"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea" 
(Dooda-dit-dooda)
(Dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

"Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) 

"What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) 
"But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea"

Lock the bus undo the chain
Getting all to hot, gotta head on Fifth and Main

You don't even know my name

Well everybody's gone to the everybody shell

Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy

I don't like blood into the chain
A dirty sun will burn away
Do you even want to stay

Are you coming through, do you want me to, take your body
It would be so cool, to be cool with you, I said lordy lordy
Where'd ya get that bruise, do you want me to
Take your body

Bought it all and it's all untrue I

Burning bush and a busted knee you

It's time to undergo
Somewhere in Mexico

A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you

Searching for an Eskimo, someone, like you

In the name of Jesus Christ I
Sold my son and I named my price I
Sold, just a little love

Who will be my Eskimo
That's what I wanna know

Somewhere in Mexico

A simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

Go, toe to toe in the whole, world to find an Eskimo

They say, in chess you've got to kill the queen and then you made it 
Oh, I do you
A funny thing, the king who gets himself assassinated 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 

You took a town by storm, the mess you made was nominated 
Oh, I do you
Now, put away your welcome, soon you'll find you've over stayed it 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 

The medicated state of mind you've found is over-rated 
Oh, I do you
You saw it all come down and now its time to imitate it 
Hey now, every time I lose altitude 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 

Come on God, do I seem bullet proof... 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime
This time my fortune's faded 

So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while my fortune faded 
Never mind the consequences of the crime

It must have been your funny face
It must have been your love
Must have been your paper chase
That wasn't quite enough

Must have been your tiny dance that
Made me laugh out loud
Must have been your angel dust that
Put me on your cloud

You're the reason why
You're the reason I

It must have been your love
It must have been your love... I said

It must have been your love... in a little bit
It must have been your love

It must have been your poppy eyes
That made me step outside
It must have been the sight of tears that
Let me know I cried

It must have been your bunny shake
It must have been your love
A lot of girls won't come around they
Treat me like a wolf

It must have been your love
It must have been your love... I said
It must have been your love... I gotta give it that
It must have been your love

You're my angel, baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo-lo-lo-lolita
Let her see me deep in love

You're the reason why
You're the reason I

It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love

You're my angel baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo-lo-lo-lolita
Let her see me deep in love

Lopsided eyes and a crooked frown
Make more of life, just settle down
Every single little princess needs a crown
Make more of life, just settle down

It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love
It must have been your love

I told you before, stay away from my door 
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
The freaks on the phone, won't leave me alone 
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother 
No! 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Now that I showed you what I been through 
Don't take nobody's word what you can do 
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky 
Now that I found out I know I can cry 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand 
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man 
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa 
They didn't want me so they made me a star 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you 
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do 
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky 
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes 

I, I found out! 
I, I found out! 

I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all 
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul 
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine 
No one can harm you, feel your own pain 

I, I found out! 
I, I found this out! 
I, I found out!

Bang on my window if
You want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when
She took her little book out

I'm steady loving on the
Lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will
So advantageous

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight

Under the hula moon I'm
Going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you
Is looking like a sculpture

This recreation is amusing
And confusing
You never knew that it
Could feel so good while losing

What you lose?
Your virginity

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

My intuition was a
Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in

Curl up with lover we
Could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above I'll
Take the time to thank it

Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

I want to bury my face
Deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa
But they call her Desdemona

Come out and see me for
Some street communication
I think it's sweet of you
To be my motivation

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always seemed
To stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One look was all it took
And now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance to
Show you I love you
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Let you go baby
Now since I've been true where it's at
I want you back!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch
Burn it up, no need to reconcile

Come and see me, I'm your west end perfect stranger, in America
Lady on that state's so full of style

Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin' night and day (?)
No one said that you would need a crowd

The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
And now I only see your face in clouds

Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

Tell me so (?)
Do you know
Does it show
When I'm low

And then again, when I feel your love from far away, I think of yesterday
I see a family we know how to smile

There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along
There comes a time when we will walk that mile

Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

Stand up, turn around, beat it out
You gotta sound, Joe
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

On the corner into my car
I drive forever never get far
The 45 is slowly getting loaded
I send another song to my star

California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it off
Take more than your...

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

A pendulum inside of my bed
Swingin' low, I hope to get hit
The overflow is slow, but not enough no
Another drop will never fix it

California mountains in the mornin'
Get along, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get if off
Take more than your friends

If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

I shut it down the look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead a' covered in flies
The big sleep without a bed of roses
The light of day will never tell lies

All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement
Take more than your friends

If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man

On the river into my dock
I paddle thought the shadow and fog
To ponder all of those who came before me
Another piece for building my arch

Let's make evil
Let's make good
I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirty wood
Go down on you

Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me

The water's falling clear
Interiors deceive I fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away

Let's get soft
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red

Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head

The water's falling clear
Interiors deceive I fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away

I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame

Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love

Some seem dirty
Some stay clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange

The water's falling clear
Interiors deceive I fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away

Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame

I will follow

I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see

A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found

Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give it to me
Just give up your eyes
Oh

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
Follow

I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.

My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.

Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

Say goodnight
She waits for me to turn out the light
Really still
She waits to break my will.


Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, Yo-ho-ho.
Yes, and I know the truth about you.
She cat.

And in the daylight
A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the one


Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, Yo-ho-ho.
Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.

Yes, and I know the truth about you
She cat.

Into the heart of a child
I stay awhile
But I can go there.

Into the heart of a child
I can smile
I can go there.

Into the heart, into the heart of a child
I can go back
I can stay awhile.
I can look straight
Into the heart.

Into the heart.

Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
You say how long

It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

Boys and girls
Go to school
And girls
They make children
Not like this one

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood

One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There's a place I go
When I am far away
There's a TV show
And I can go

Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go
Oh, oh, oh

There's a picture book
With colour photographs
There's a comic strip
That makes me laugh

Sometimes the lady takes me
Sometimes I don't let go

Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys
Stories for boys

There's a place I go
And it's a part of me
There's a radio
And I will go

Sometimes the hero takes me
Sometimes I don't let go

Stories for boys

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

A picture in grey
Dorian Gray
Just me by the sea.

And I felt like a star
I felt the world could go far
If they listened to what I said.
Just me, my ego by the sea.

It washes my feet
It washes my feet
Splashes the soles of my shoes.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
I'm dreaming, you're awake
If I wasn't sleeping, what's at stake?

A day without me.

Whatever the feelings, I keep feeling
What are the feelings you left behind?

A day without me.

Started a landslide in my ego
Looked from the outside to the world I left behind.
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then let go
In the world I left behind
They shed a tear and on they go.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Bright morning lights
Wipe the sleep
From another day's eye.
Turn away from the wall
And there's nothing at all.
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed.

I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie.

Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep, I discovered the one
But she was gone with the morning sun.

I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud, we lie.

Another time, another place
We lie.
Another time, another place.
We lie.
Another time, another place
We lie.
Your time, your place.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Boy, stupid boy
Don't sit at the table
Until you're able to.

Toy, broken toy
You can shout and shout, 'til you're inside out
But if you don't know.
Electric Co.
If you don't know
Electric co.

Red, running red
You play for real
But the toy can feel
Holding your head
You won't shout
You still beg
If you don't know
The Electric Co.

If you don't know.
Electric co.
If you don't know
Electric co.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Back to the cold restless streets at night
Talk to myself about tomorrow night.
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now?
It's always the same.

Who is it now? Who calls me inside?
Are the leaves on the trees just a living disguise?
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.

Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.

Life through a window
A discoloured pain
Mrs Brown's washing is always the same
I walk the street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again to the street melody.

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.

Do you feel in me
Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling?
This love is like a tightrope
Hanging from my ceiling?

But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know.

Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees.

Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.

Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows, shadows, shadows.
Shadows and tall trees.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Into the heart of a child
I stay awhile
But I can go there

Into the heart of a child
I can smile
I can't go there

Into the heart, into the heart of a child
I can't go back
I can't stay awhile
Into the heart

Into the heart

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I will follow

I was on the outside
When you said, you said you needed me
And I was looking at myself
I was blind, I could not see

A boy tries hard to be a man
His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found

Walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow

Your eyes make a circle
I see you when I go in there
Your eyes
Your, your, your eyes
Your eyes, just give it to me
Just give up your eyes
Oh

If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
If you walk away, walk away
I walk away, walk away
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
I will follow
Follow

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
And the boys and girls collide
To the music in my ear

Hear the children crying 
And I know it's time to go 
I hear the children crying  
Take me home 

A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong 

Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home 

Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

Thank you
Don't mention it
I'm pleased to meet you
Don't think I'm very good at this
Let me show

I don't wanna know
I just wanna go (down)

F-f-falling... the world is by your side
Falling... did you find a place to hide

I just wanna know
I just wanna go

T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you

She said, the twenty second floor
But I said, I can't think what it's for

I just wanna know
I don't wanna go

T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you
T-t-touching you

I'm t-t-touching you

Gonna push it, wish they got it right
What they call you when you're in life
Ran for an ocean, they running's done
Running for a lady at the speed of life
Of life

My question, at least you got it right
They got you when you're in sight
Running from the ocean on stepping stones
Running from a lady at the speed of life
Of life

On your way inside a mirror turning in here, in his hand
Love's still well if father keeps me home, it really is
I am higher, way up, fall

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

They stood on his shadow, they always do
All he wanted to spoil the view
Of people and places, second-hand faces 
He saw but never knew

Oh, oh, oh, oh

She looked like a painting, a picture of you
Depending on your point of view
She laughed with the others, they call out her name
She smiled, she said
Goodbye

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night

They met at a streetlight though she never knew
All he wanted was to spoil the view
And just for a second, it felt like a year
He waited for her second tear

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh...

On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
On a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night

Can you soar any higher, if you can't let go?
To save her in the fire, she won't say no

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh...

Downtown...

Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
You say how long

It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

Boys and girls
Go to school
And girls
They make children
Not like this one

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood

One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion that it was out of control

Finding out 
I'm finding out the things 
That I've been talking about 
I'm finding all the things 
That I've been missing out 
Finding all the things 
I lose my mind 
Sometimes fall behind 

You and I we live on the big ship 
And time goes by 
You make up and I believe a lady's lie 
The skinheads call it strawberries and cream 
Sometimes I scream 

Boy-girl, boy-girl 
When a boy meets a girl 
Boy-girl 
We go out 

A picture or a disco or a roundabout 
I walk you home, I hold you there 
You're giving out 
I open doors so I can shut your face 
Know your place 

Boy-girl, boy-girl 
When a boy meets a girl 
Boy-girl 

You can take me in your hand 
Stand back, leave me, come in 
Up and down and all around 
You will sideways to the ground

Wake up 
The dawn of another dull day 
Take up 
Your dreams and on your way 
Oh oh ooh 

Daylight 
Mother stands in the hall 
Last night 
Head against the wall 
Oh oh ooh 

When night turns to day 
And the children come out to play 
Another day 
Stop, shake out 
They came my way 
Oh oh ooh... 

Boy, salute in a street uniform 
Toy, soldier ripped and torn 
Oh oh ooh 

When night turns to day 
And the children come out to play 
Another day 

Stop, shout 
They came my way 
Oh oh ooh

I look into his eyes
They're closed but I see something.
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry.

My body grows and grows
It frightens me, you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known.

Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play.
It's all, it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way.

Twilight, darkened day
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, night and day
Twilight, can't find my way.

In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man
In the shadow, boy meets man.

Mr. Burk is off to work
He carries papers in his carrier bag
Mr. Postman takes his bag back
Those angry dogs, those angry dogs

It's a cartoon world

Mrs. Brown is off to town
She carries shopping in her shopping bag
Mr. Brown is working hard
For some degree at university

It's a cartoon world

It's a cartoon world
It really is
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world

Uncle Tony hates a drag
He didn't give me a lot of time, dear
Jack and Jill go up the hill
To pick some flowers and daffodils

It's a cartoon world
It's a cartoon world

Julie says, John I'm getting nowhere
I wrote this letter, hope to get just someplace soon
I want to get up
When I wake up
When I get up
I fall down.

Julie wake up, Julie tell the story
You wrote the letter, said you were gonna get there someday
Gonna walk in the sun
And the wind and the rain
Never walk back again
I know you fall down
You're falling down
You fall down
You fall down.

Julie say something, Julie say you're sorry
You're gonna get better, you better not leave me here anyway
I want to get up
When you wake up
But when I get up
I fall down
I'm falling down
I fall down
I broke myself.

I fall, I fall down
I'm falling down
When you fall
I fall with you
And when you're falling down
Is when I hit the ground.
I fall with you
I fall down.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I was talking, I was talking to myself
Somebody else talk, talk, talking.
I couldn't hear a word, a word he said.

He was my brother
I said there was no other way out of here
Be my brother (Brother)
Got to get out, got to get out.

I was walking, I was walking into walls
And back again
I just keep walking
I walk up to a window to see myself

And my reflection
When I thought about it
My direction
Going nowhere, going nowhere.

No-one, no-one is blinder
Than he who will not see.
No-one, no-one is blinder
Than me.

I was talking, I was talking in my sleep
I can't stop talk, talk, talking
I'm talking to you, it's up to you

Be my brother
There is no other way out of here
Be my brother
Got to get out, got to get out
Got to get out of here.

It's falling, it's falling
And outside a building comes tumbling down.
And inside a child on the ground
Says he'd do it again

And what am I to do?
What in the world am I to say?
There's nothing else to do.
He says he'll change the world some day
I rejoice.

This morning I fell out of bed
When I woke up to what he had said
Everything's crazy
But I'm too lazy to lie

And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world
But I can change the world in me
Rejoice
Rejoice

And what am I to do?
Just tell me what am I supposed to say?
I can't change the world
But I can change the world in me

I rejoice

Rejoice 
In the rest of the world

The wind of life and air from above smells of death.
Angels sing of the end.
Nothing you say and nothing you try can change time.
Human race prepares to die...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Slit my wrists, take away the pain
Slit my throat, There's no one to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion
Restless nights, they're not far away.

AWAY!

Right?


I came here for something and I'm not turning back
Strong in the mind, but you still hold my keys
Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience, but it means the world to me

You have the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be

Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death

I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees, forgive me please
Tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion

You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, right now,
Now you turn the other way.

You've turned away from me,
The future's much too far away to see.
I hope you learn the truth,
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Darkness coats us.
The smell of fall.
Changing season.
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
The chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.
The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feeling the thoughts of the dead.
True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, still there, teaching me.
You can feel it tonight.
The wood has rotted away.
Take the time absorb it.
Their time is slipping away.
Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.
They still breathe.
Come join us.

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.
(3x)

And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.
Time crumbles away.

Smell the burning embers, night flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.
And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.
Time crumbles away.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

A living nightmare, asleep but still aware.
The endless torture.
The painless pleasure.
I grasp myself.
Trying to regain control.
I experience and learn.
In another faction of my mind.
So confused.
But everything makes perfect sense.
Can't feel the pain.
Emotional pain's so much deadlier.
Lost, you've just been raped.
Pain. Your friends can't help you.
Why won't they help you? Another reality.
This can't be happening.
Why is this happening?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck. Are you?
Trying hard to figure out what's done.
I scramble but now I run.
The images in my head.
All the problems that I've been fed.
All the problems that I've been fed.
Punching slowly my mind can't change the speed.
As my victims bleed.
No matter what I do or how hard I try.
I can't use my abilities.
Use my abilities.
Art of Illusion.
My razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
But I can not take their soul.
Punching through jello, stabbing not killing.
Disappointment. Discomfort.
My razor sharp knife's edge, pierces my victim's body.
But I can't take their soul.
Punching through jello, stabbing not killing.
Disappointment. Discomfort.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls.
Rain plays a heart warming tune, on the pavement.
Emotions stir.
A feeling of warmness, compassion, I feel at home.
Disguised by surroundings.
As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance on their mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
As the torn and left in the cold, seek vengeance on mistreated lives.
A silhouette stands still.
A cactus on a warm summer night.
But the rain falls cold and the moon shines bright.
Black as night.
Cold as ice.
Warm as home.
Ready to live.
Stars they shoot.
In a clear.
Across the sky.
As does my time.
Waiting, wanting, feeling, emotion.
Crying, breaking, loving, nothing.

Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone, thinking good times, and why'd they go?

Falling down, breaking down parts of me.
Falling down, breaking down parts of me.
Fuck. I need this place to get away from you.

Clouds swallow the moon, and I'm alone, thinking good times, and why'd they go?
(3x)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The mark I breathe on you.
It's burning through your soul.
The breath I waste.
Losing control.
I bleed in pain.
Testing what I know.
Lips soaked in deceit.
Pull me from here.
No one's innocent.
So why do I feel bad?
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me (up on me).
Guilt. Tearing me up inside.
The innocent.
An evil in disguise.
The face of beauty to fall for.
I fall to my knees, deceitful.
Brought down by feelings of regret.
Again your mind has failed the test.
Not everyone feels the same.
Pacifist blinded by the game.
Stand tall. They'll break your heart.
Stand tall. They'll smash your ego.
Stand tall. They'll tear you down.
Stand tall. Scar your soul.
Break your thought.
Fuck your mind.
The mark I breathe on you.
It's burning through your soul.
The breath I waste.
Losing control.
I bleed in pain.
Testing what I know.
Lips soaked in deceit.
Pull me from this hole.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Your hazel green tint eyes watching every move I make.
And the feeling of doubt. It's erased.
I'll never feel alone again, with you by my side.
You're the one, and in you I confide.

And we have gone through good and bad times.
But your unconditional love, was always on my mind.
You've been there from the start for me.
And your love's always been, true as can be.
I'll give my heart to you.
I give my heart,
Cause nothing can compare in this world to you.
(2x)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

So much time I've wasted.
I can truly say I never thought it would come to this.
Never would I doubt you, but the truth kept smacking me in the face.
Reality. You never stopped to think and you ripped us apart.
How could you? Now our time is gone but it's still breaking my heart.
Tears run down as I think of the days we've had, and the memories will last forever,
But you and I have died and gone our separate ways.
You are the one.
You are the wrong one.
Breaking the mold.
Going your own way.
All I feel, betrayal.

So much time I've wasted, and I never thought it'd come to this. (4x)

We had something great, then it was washed away.
We had something more, then I can explain.
I'm sorry. No! We had something great, then it was washed away.
No! Not all friendships last, the genuine are harder to take.
No! Time to start again, hope someday you'll think of me.
No! The end reality, I know someday I'll think of you.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When you see them coming in form.
And they say they do what's best for you.
Fighting for one total control.
They are planned and organized for you.
Breaking their hold. Breaking their hold of control they strive.
To keep you down, behind your back, the time has come, the end is near.
It's when you sleep, so late at night, and in the light, getting prepared.
It's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system, you won't exist.
They are the few, with all the power,
Our system screams, we can't let them tear our hearts out.
Screaming, pulling on our pride.
Stand together for the right cause, one system to our demise.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Forgotten faces.
Lost in yesterdays realm.
Drained with confusion.
Where did it all go?
Look into the past, look into their faces.
Never, the thought of being time fucked.
But now they're all gone and all that's left is this blank faced picture.
Ninety percent, nothing was done, nothing accomplished,
Coasting through life didn't seize the day.
No one ever realized that they're already dead.
By the time you realize, you'll be dead too.
Without another chance to save the world,
These things they're gone, you're gone, forgotten.

Now your face in my picture frame. (4x)

It's gone, forever.
Right before my very eyes.
And just when I thought I made light of things.
It slips away, into darkness.
My life passes now I see.
Just what this world does hold for me.
It's getting hard, harder to breathe.
Am I out of time is that what this means?
Well that's what it means.
That's what it means, you and me try to breathe.
Now you. Realize.
Your life, flies by.
Now I. Realize.
My life, I die.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I don't want to know.
And I don't want to see you in this place.
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face.
And I don't want to hear anymore.
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor.
Get the fuck out of here now.
Come on you kids, stand your ground.
This is your show, it's your family.
All of my friends there for me.

There's four-hundred more of us then them.
So kick them out.
Keep it positive.
Keep it real.
Keep it true.
Together with my friends.
I'll be there for you.
(2x)

Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
This is to my brothers, I'll be there for you.
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through.
This is to my family.
I'll be there for you.

I don't want to know.
And I don't want to see you in this place.
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face.
And I don't want to hear anymore.
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
The ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.
One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.
There's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
No need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
Look what's happening now.
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated different 'cause they're not the same as me or you?
You live your whole life staring at a wall, your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall.
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids.
The ones who go out and the ones that are taught to live.
One groups taught how and the other group is taught why.
There's no need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.
No need to tell you what's in my mind, but in the game of life I'm doing fine.
No reason to tell you which way to be.
Cause the streets have opened my eyes to see.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I see you fading away from us.
I'll miss you very much.
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams, and pride still running high, always on your side.
But I wanted more for you.
You can't go on this way.
And now I see it all fall through.
We pray for better days.
Stuck alone and scared.
Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.
I don't want to see you like this.
We all tried to save you but missed.
I still feel the hope on your road.
Now come back to us like the days of the old.
I still feel you there, trying to get on top.
You'll always have my support, in my heart.
People you've hurt.
Friends that you've lied to.
But we understand, and that not (you) can see the end of the road,
I can see it too, for you, I'm scared, if I lose you, I'm not prepared.
This time, if you die.
I watch you, right before my eyes.
Just trust me, and listen.
You have no self control.
This will take your life.

Overdose and then indulge until you die.
Pondering, we all ask the question why.
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad.
And we are left the only family that you've ever had.
(2x)

I wanted more for you.
You can't go on this way.
And now I see it all fall through.
We pray for better days.
Stuck alone and scared.
Throw your life away and now choking on your pride may be the only way.

Help you see it through.
Fight this me and you.
Reaching deep inside.
Problems not just you is what we find.
Our friendship makes it mine.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Wake the ones and rise tonight
Fallen souls we shine so bright

Rise now and ever
We command you
Rise now and ever
We command you

No one can touch us

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'll try, she said, as she walked away
Try not to lose you
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
I'll be here waiting tested and secure

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me

When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin

Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze till I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague

Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me

When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Give me your hand
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man, punishment too great to bear)
Conceived and born was one of light
Rain and dark, the other born black night

Raise your head and taste the courage
(The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brother's eyes tonight...

It's cold tonight as the clouds turn gray
And from my hands to my brother's grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man, crestfallen man...

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go

Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

With this ink in our skin we've sealed our fate,
And the axe comes early
(Only naturally) So what does that matter?
There's a bed of skeletons waiting for me,
On the other side
They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath)
Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog
(Nothing past a grey wall) see past the stereotype
Belief, structure built up in you.
I'll tear you down and the one who created you

If they didn't have One how would they act?
If we didn't have hope how would we behave?
Would they still feel remorse
If they slaughtered innocent beings?
Or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?

A good friend once told me you are memory
Without it we equal nothing
And all I can see is the place I wanna be
Suddenly my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down
But keep away from me... keep away from me

(It's hard, to keep me in this place, keep away from me)

We may have created the beginning, mentally
We may have created the beginning, physically
To the end of our human existence...

I see through you
The fear that's in your eyes

A good friend once told me you are memory
Without them we equal nothing
All I can see is the place I wanna be
Timeless my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Nights coming fast, suns going down - confused
I don't know the answers but neither do you.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hard news, taken harder, don't look to me
Disappointed, we don't agree, I don't need your praise...
(Don't look my way for help.
From the beginning you came to me)
Never asked you to like me,
I don't want your praise (we won't play your games)
Look down on me, spit in my face,
You're nothing to me... not to me

Darkened eyes you'll see,
There is no hope, no savior in me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care,
What happens to me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)

My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(Don't look my way for help,
From the beginning you came to me)
Asking questions, predetermined answers,
You won't find them here. (we don't want your opinion)
And I don't want you. I won't let you think,
Compromise is near, 'Cause it's not near.

Darkened eyes you'll see,
There is no hope, no savior in me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by, no one will care,
What happens to me
"Don't look this way, don't breathe this way, don't stare this way, anymore)

I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask
You'll never know
You're left behind and I'll be exposed

Far away, you keep on trying...
Holding me down, breaking away,
Trying to distance my life.
Not one in the crowd, but one with the answer
The one that could change your mind

But it's not true, I don't need you
Don't waste your time, and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, I won't soothe your soul
And in the end you're all dead to me...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Black enchanting eyes,
Cut through my heart
With no regret or sign of life
They tear apart my pride
And cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles, haunting every step
And they won't stop hunting me down
I know the time will come,
When all around me's burned
And you'll still see me there
Asking where you went to
And what person brought you here
And why you left the burning children
Cold out in the night
And calling for you all alone...

Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down

They'll find you alone,
And your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
They seek more then vengeance
Look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
Look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
Burn for the rest of time

Hear the haunting words (They'll find you alone)
Lost children with no heart are crying (Turning their hearts into stone)
And you're the lost mother they're calling (They seek more then vengeance) (Go now run and hide)
I hear them crying at night (Your pain is their satisfaction)
Outside when the planets are falling (For the rest of time)
They want to feel and know you hear them (Go now run and hide)

Dark in their hearts,
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down

Eternal Rest... in time
Eternal Rest... in time

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

We keep writing talking and planning,
But everything is changing.
We all know what to do but no one does it.
Now this time has passed and full of regret.
Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone.
When they get back, it won't be the same

My life, you've always been there.
Now you're gone and my head's spinning.
Left the childhood, left the memories,
Left the good times in the past.
Moving on... your time has run out.
Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait.
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends.

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life.
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night.

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past.
So rarely I get to see your face.
Growing I looked to you in guidance.
We knew that time would kill us,
But you're still so close to me.

To me you were my life.
To me you were my soul companion.
Now you are so far away.
Nothing can take away the time and the memories we had.
Come back - to the days when we were young,
Come back - to the days when nothing mattered.
To the days when nothing mattered

And I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life,
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awake, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb

No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through...

You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears

No... This gun has stopped time in it's tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold winds embrace

I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time...
Close your eyes or look away,
Fate exposed and won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me

My voice has been taken from me.
The more I listen, the more I have to say.

You're all gone to me, (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my Mother shed tears
(And taste the blood she cries
And taste the blood she cries)

I'll watch you call, calling for me,
You can't bring back time...
Close your eyes or look away,
Fate exposed and won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings,
Descending entity in me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

Building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me,
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone.
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide... suicide

I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side, please...

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone. Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.
(Take back time)

I can see just fine, with you in my life,
There by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow
Nightmare- full of pain
Nightmare- full of pain

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll
Take away... Take away... Take away... Take away

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I care for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend.
He's gone. Nothing will take back time.
I need him back, but nothing will take back time.

I can see just fine, with you in my life,
There by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow (x2)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Dust begins to fall, to the ground
The air is cold and thin
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
This will never end, When I'll bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, Just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, It's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

Outside shell is strong, Confident
But slowly eats away
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
Through my pores it seems to seep
When I'll bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, Just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, It's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

And why you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing

There's nowhere to run and hide
When you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head
Better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house
No one's around

Don't acknowledge right, Just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far, It's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

But in my life, I wanted more, I needed more
I taste... more!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Lived through you,
Safe with how we lived our lives,
With how it all turned out.
(But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout,
Will make you change your mind

Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

When I see you, I can read it in your eyes,
Fate misunderstood.
(But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for,
Thinking with your heart.

Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know.
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be all right
I know, I know
(I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold so black so alone)

Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by.
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold.

Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation.
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right.

Sometimes life is altered.
Break from the ropes your hands are tied.
Uneasy with confrontation. (whoa)
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

This shining city built of gold
A far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye
'Round here look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil

There sat a seven-headed beast
Ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne
But hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The beast and the harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The city dressed in jewels and gold
Fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once
As her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour

Merchants and captains of the world
Sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss
With her sins piled to the sky
The beast and the harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Looking back on her to see there's nothin' around

I don't believe in fairytales and no one wants to go to Hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set
Forever

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me though everyone that I defeat
Don"t need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away

Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (See it in my eyes)
Now I can understand
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Whoa, yeah!

You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day
The fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say

Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn ya down (You can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes)
(Chorus vocalizing) 
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Ha! Yeah, yeah!

Run from me before I tear you down (Be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (It feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away (Despise what you say - Chorus vocalizing)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (We won't be there by your side - Chorus vocalizing)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end (Chorus vocalizing)
Sweet child we'll miss you
No, so far away, far away

I can't trust anyone (Witness and see it in my eyes - Chorus vocalizing)
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies

Falling away
Can't buy back time
Burn it down anyways

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

And we're at it again, I turn around another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin, but I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're followin'

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood between the red and white and blue but it's too deep for you to see and
Everyone eventually will take the step 'cause it's in sight you take the left I'll take the right I feel the hate you've built
For me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life in judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forget
How to speak how to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do from on the outside looking in your government is listenin' to
Push you on the story of immortal father mortal son give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)
If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell and your future's a fuckin' disaster can't you see
Don't give them all the power when your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it all right
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to (run)
Running away from condition, I see you but you're running away from
You're scared seductive system

Most would claim I live a lie when pointing out it's easy to predict these things
Every color has its side, they live together vote and most won't read between these lines
Please help us, please save us of course they have control we're all the same
Up on the cross, crucified their problem drove the nail and let Him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end I'm sure they'll understand
Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder bout how you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease
I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact you gotta make it all right
Easier said than done with no place to hide and having no place to run

You've fallen asleep here in denial
Look at the way we're dyin'
How it ends I'll never know
Just live your life blind like me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis here to see, the sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

As I adjust to my new sights the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me; show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution 'cause I can't make it right
I'll make a beast out of myself, gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem
I've known it from the start all these good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me I'm too weird to live but much too rare to die

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Keep on writing you're just raping yourself (nothing can take my mind away from them)
Don't you ask about me, ask 'bout somebody else (Once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can't feel it, won't embrace it, it's overwhelming how far ya take it (Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we' re destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen (Resentment building, you've put
Our lives on hold)

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination is always unknown, I'll find my way there
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Play your game and walk away your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else (Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell (Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me, should make you worried (Long way to go and you're
Right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes sure you can't breathe (Pick at pieces of my body below)

I never bothered with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar (There's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right, I'll justify the means (Nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination is always unknown, I'll find my way there
But Goddamn Impostor are you out of your mind?

I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear (I control this ride)
My devils appetite is tonight and now I'm all right
But you Goddamn Motherfuckers always wasting my time

Play your game and walk away your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Don't try and get the best of me (No one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (Lonely, don't try and prey on me)
I feel your world keep dying, no more use in tryin'
And my body's trashed and low, but to you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And I've seen it all before but I'll settle the score, I'll never join your side

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight?
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am

Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, I remember
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met

But I know the reason why you keep this silence up
No, you don't fool me
The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Oh Lord, oh Lord

It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love

Well I wait in every day, just in case,
You decide to call
And I can hardly wait, 'cause I never thought time could pass so slowly

It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love

Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again, but now I know
It's you that I've been looking for
And day by day more and more
I know what you think, you've heard it before
Don't tell me I know
But this feeling inside my heart,
You know I'm never letting go
'Cause I think that...

It must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love

Words can only say so much
It's hard to express
The things you do to me
You're everything I could ever dreamed you'd be

This must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I held the book so tightly in my hands,
I saw your picture, heard you call my name
It was strange I could not look away
I had to be there, I wanted to go

You gave me no reason
You gave me no warning
But I was with you,
By your side
Give me the strength, so I can help you
And I can be strong now, they don't frighten me

It's written in the book

The sun is hotter than before
But inside it's cold, I wonder why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Well I believe we can make it right

It's time now
To show our feelings
Looking through you


Your heart's empty
Whatever happened to you, you can't change it,
Nowhere to run to, please, oh please don't let me down

But wait a minute I don't understand
It's getting stronger, hold my hand
Don't want to leave you I don't want to go
But I'm a' losing all control
Can't you see me I'm slipping away
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
Oh Lord

It's written in the book

I held the book so tightly in my hands
Saw your picture, heard you call my name
Oh, and even though we never, never touched
I keep waiting for you just the same

La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The roof is leaking and the wind is howling
Kids are crying 'cause the sheets are so cold
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen
I've tried to fix the fire, but you know the damn thing's too old

It's been months now, since we heard from our Mary,
I wonder if she ever made the coast
She and her young man, they both moved out there
But I sure hope they write, just to let us know

And me, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But Spring'll soon be here,
Oh God I hope it's not late

Ma and Pa lived here, and theirs before them

Tried their hardest to make it a home
Seems so long now since they passed over
Hope my children'll try to make it their own

The roof is leaking and the wind is howling
Kids are crying, 'cause the sheets are so cold
I woke this morning found my hands were frozen
I've tried to fix the fire, but you know the damn thing's too old

And me, I'm getting stronger by the minute
My wife's expecting, but I hope she can wait
'Cause this winter looks like it's gonna be another bad one
But Spring'll soon be here,
Oh God I hope it's not late

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

So you finally came right out and said it girl
What took you so long
It was in your eyes, that look's been there for too long
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh

I think about it from time to time
When I'm lonely and on my own

I try to forget and yet, still rush to the telephone
I'm waiting in line
Would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh

Well it feels like something you want so bad
Then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had
You can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch
And I feel it coming at me
I can feel it coming at me

Or did I miss again
I think I missed again oh
Or did I miss again
I think I missed again

I'm waiting in line, but would you say if I was wasting my time

Or did I miss again...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Just as I thought I'd make it
You walk back into my life
Just like you never left

Just as I'd learned to be lonely
You call up to tell me
You're not sure if you're ready
But ready or not, you'll take what you've got and leave

Leave me alone with my heart
I'm putting the pieces back together again
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
I can do without you, know what I mean...

I wish I could write a love song,
To show you the way I feel
Seems you don't like to listen
Oh but like it or not, take what you've got and leave

Leave me alone with my heart
It's broken in two and I'm not thinking too straight
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams
You've taken everything else, you know what I mean

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I never thought I'd ever get tired of playing games
But I've been holding back for too long
Now the time has come to get it right
Now's the time to show them all that they're wrong

'Cause they said thunder and they said lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels all right

Never ever did believe in guiding lights
'Cause what you didn't hold, slipped away
Oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoe
'Cause things look like they're going my way

'Cause they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels all right

I never ever did believe in a second chance
You get, just one crack of the whip, that's all
If you played the game, you got treated right
Oh but I'm not playing the game, no more

'Cause they say thunder and they say lightning
It would never strike twice
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels all right

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

If you feel it do it,
You don't need a reason
For all you know it could be good for you

To show your feelings
Don't just leave them
Do the things you believe in, it's all right
Don't worry turn around, I will still be here

I'm not moving... no really
You just try and push me out
No, I'm not moving... no really
No, I'm not going anywhere tonight

If you think it, say it
'Cause no one will stop you
Don't keep quiet, just 'cause you think you ought to
Feel free to shout it loud, speak your mind, spit it out

'Cause I'm not moving... no really
You just try and push me out
No I'm not moving I can sit it out
No really, there's no hurry
So don't worry turn around, I will still be here

If it hurts don't do it
'Cause no one can take you make you drink
And no one can tell you what you think
Remember if your spirit starts to sink
Don't worry turn around, I will still be here

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I read all the letters...
I read each word that you've sent to me
And though its past now, and your words...
All the memories I've had, still remain

I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no one knows
Oh sure my friends all come 'round,
But I'm in a crowd, and own my own
It's 'cause you're gone now, but your heart... heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again

You see I'd heard the rumours
I knew before you let me know
But I didn't believe it, not you
No, you would not let me go

Seems I was wrong,
But I love, love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away

But just remember...

If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy,
Then you know, coming back is harder

Hoh...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, oh it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is beginning, oh it is beginning

That love is all and love is ev'ryone
It is knowing, oh it is knowing
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, oh it is believing
So play the game, existence to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I dreamed of, once in a lullaby

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Well, you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace
Drag my name all over the place
I don't care anymore
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in
You won't catch me crying 'cause I just can't win
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

I don't care what you say
I don't play the same games you play

'Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
And it seems to me there's a means to and end
They don't care anymore
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind
I don't care anymore I don't care no more

I don't care what you say
We never played by the same rules anyway

I won't be there anymore
Get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore

Well, I don't care now what you say
'Cause ev'ry day I'm feeling fine with myself
And I don't care now what you say
Hey I'll do all right by myself
'Cause I know

'Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard
And you laughed in my face 'cause you held all the cards
I don't care anymore.
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
'Cause all I want of you is just a let me be
I don't care anymore
D'you hear?
I don't care no more

I don't care what you say
I never did believe you much anyway

I won't be there no more
So get out of my way
Let me by
I got better things to do with my time
I don't care anymore
D'you hear? I don't care anymore
I don't care no more
You listening? I don't care no more
No more!

Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah

You know I don't care anymore
Don't care no more
No more, no more, no more
Don't care no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, n-no more

When I opened your letter yesterday
I could not believe my eyes
'Cause I've already given all I have to give
And I think it must have slipped your mind
But I remember not so long ago
I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
They don't seem to realize
They're listening, but they're not hearing me
They're being too cruel to be kind
Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
'Cause I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna wake up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
'Cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me
Nothing can make me stay

Oh, 'cause you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through
Never meant it to show
It started happening, that's all you know.

Oh, I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do?
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
But over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
'Cause nothing can change all the things that you do to me
Nothing can make me stay

'Cause you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

My mom and dad both say
I must be crazy to be this infatuated
But I know you know
We got something special never felt before
You get me going just looking at you
And the feeling's not hard to recognise so
All right I'll come out in the open with it
Will you walk out with me?

'Cause you're the first girl I've ever loved
Tell me do you feel the same way
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest
'Cause I know who I am

Your skin is smooth as silk and your eyes like stars
You're just like a picture book standing there
But I can't go on
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way that I do

I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china
'Cause I know it's your first time

Your mum and dad don't like me
And they tell me every time I call around to see you
I don't know why
'Cause I always straighten my tie and comb my hair
I know your brother thinks that
I'm a limp wristed wimp from the other side of town
I know he's got me wrong
Because I'm really not like that, I'll tell you why

You're the first girl I've ever loved
Tell me do you feel the same way
Well I'll show you I'm not like all the rest
'Cause I know who I am

I remember the very first time I held your hand
And that was the last time you were so close to me
But I can't go on
No, I can't go on thinking you don't feel the same way as I do

I'll be so careful I'll hold you like china
I'll promise not to hurt you I'll hold you like china
You won't feel nothing, I'll hold you like china
'Cause I know it's your first time

I know you know and now I want to, I want to tell everybody
I know you know and now I want them all to see

You said you would, you didn't and I wanna know why
And don't make no excuses
You promised, you promised, you better explain
Though I don't know what the use is
You said you could, you couldn't, now why did you lie?
You made it look so easy
You did it, why do it, what was your point?
Laughing while you tease me

Oh, do you know and do you care?

I said I did, I shouldn't 'cause the magic will go
It happened once before
You'll see it, you'll steal it and take it away
And then come back for more
Don't say you would, you wouldn't 'cause I saw you myself
It's too late for your reason
You're lying, you're lying, you've done it this time
I'm sick of all the cheating

Oh, well do you know and do you care?

'Cause I watch you
Oh every day I watch you pass me by
I'll get you
Yes in the end I'll get you
Just watch me try

Oh you make it hard to be hard but I'm trying my best
'Cause down inside I'm burnin'
You want it, you got it, now take it and run
I'll hide how much it's hurtin'

Oh, well do you know and do you care?
Oh, well do you know and do you care?
Oh, do you know, and do you care?

I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes
(Well now wait)

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

Well it don't matter to me what you say, what you say
And it don't matter to me what you're doing all right, all right.

Because I've heard it all so many times before
Just what you're saying and
I don't really want to hear it all no more, no more
Don't wanna hear it no more

'Cause there's no way that you can run
'Cause I'm gonna find you
And there's nobody that you can turn to
'Cause I'll be behind you just to remind you

That it don't matter to me what you say, what you say, say, say, saying
Well it didn't matter to me what you're doing all right, all right

It seems to me it's been too easy for you for too long
So you'd better climb down before you fall and hurt your pride, your pride
You're gonna hurt your pride

'Cause there' nowhere that you can run to
'Cause I'm gonna find you
And there's no place that you can stay
'Cause I'll be behind you just to remind you

That it don't matter to me what you do
Well it don't matter to me, I'm talking to you, talking to you
Well it don't matter to me believe me
Well it don't matter to me

I can hear through these walls
I can hear it when they're foolin' around
I can hear through these walls and
I hear every sign, every sound
I can hear through these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down
Every word that they say
Every move they make feels it's coming my way

My favorite moment, putting the glass up next to the wall
Imagination, though I see nothing, I hear it all
Putting my sign up, do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out
Oh, when my clothes, they're all laid out

I can see through my windows
I can see the girls and the boys
I can see through my windows and
I can imagine the noise
I can see through my windows
I can see them playing with toys
Oh I hope it won't end
If I promise not to touch, just be a friend

Life is so lonely and I don't get high off just being me
I like pretending wanting to touch them, wanting to see
It's only normal creeping behind you, now don't shout, 'cause it's alright
They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight

Ooh I'm feeling like I'm locked in a cage no way in, no way out
And it gets so lonely am I really asking a lot
Just to reach out and touch somebody?
'Cause when I look through my windows or open my door
I can feel it all around me

And I can hear through these walls
I can hear it when they're foolin' 'round
I can hear through these walls
I can hear every sight, every sound
I can hear through these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down
And every word that they say
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way

Ah yeah
Ah yeah
Ah yeah
Ah yeah

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to tell you it'll all work out all right

Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away
Don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

You can look at him the way you did me
And hold him close say you're never letting go
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself
But you ain't fooling me

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of the wall
Oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right

'Cause I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely
But hoping you could be strong
But can you look at me straight
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?

So don't let him steal your heart away
No, don't let him steal your heart away

Well he's gonna try to make it work for you
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this
But whatever you do
Think about me, oh! and don't be fooled by his kiss

And don't let him steal your heart away
Please, don't let him steal your heart away

And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back
And don't take my pictures off of your wall
Oh, did you hear me?
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life
And just give me one more chance
I'll show you I'm right
You know I'm right

'Cause you were lonely and you needed a friend
And he was there at the right time with the right smile
Just a shoulder to lean on
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be all right
But he's no good for you
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this
And whatever you do
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Why can't it wait 'til morning?
We can talk about it then
'Cause I've had a drink too many
And my troubles, well I ain't got any

Why can't it wait 'til daylight?
Things will seem much clearer then
I'm tired and my eyes are weary
And I just want you lying here with me

So close your eyes
I'll make it oh, so nice

Well I don't wanna think about what we've said
And I don't wanna know why we hurt ourselves
'Cause I just wanna hold you so close to me
It'll take care of itself and I wanna sleep

So why can't it wait 'til next time?
'Cause that time may never come
Stay here with your arms around me
You're going nowhere without me

So close your eyes
I'll make it oh, so nice for you

There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Su-Sussudio oh, oh

Oh, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Su-Sussudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
Su-Sussudio oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Su--su-su-sussudio oh, oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Su-Sussudio, oh

Ah, she's all I need all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Sussudio, I just say the word
Su-Sussudio,  I just say the word
Su-Sussudio,  I'll say the word

We know you really only wanna hear
The things we like to say
But if I said to you please don't do it
You do it anyway
Sometimes I know, we gotta be cruel
Be cruel to be kind
When I ask you, what you see in me
You say our love is blind

'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Whenever I think I know you better
Better than I know myself
I open up and give you everything
Then you say, O.K. what else
And when I run away you always cry
You always over react
But I don't know if you know how you really feel
But you better know before I get back

'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Just try to remember
Now I'm the one you love
You told me, ooh try to remember
I'm the one you're always thinking of
You told me, please try to remember
Before I walk away
Remember
It's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday

'Cause only you know and I know
The things we mean to say
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say, yes
Only you know and I know
The things we mean to say

Only you know and I know...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

While I sit here trying to think of things to say
Someone lies bleeding in a field somewhere
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go
I've seen all I wanna see today

While I sit here trying to move you anyway I can
Someone's son lies dead in a gutter somewhere
And it would seem that we've still got a long long way to go
But I can't take it anymore

Turn it off if you want to
Switch it off it will go away
Turn it off if you want to
Switch it off or look away

While I sit and we talk and talk and we talk some more
Someone's loved one's heart stops beating in a street somewhere
So it would seem we've still got a long long way to go, I know
I've heard all I wanna hear today

Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)
Switch it off it will go away (switch it off it will go away)
Turn it off if you want to (turn it off if you want to)
Switch it off or look away (switch it off or look away)

Switch it off
Turn it off

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's over, oh yes it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long
She said it, and now she'll regret it
But if she'd ask anyone
I know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late

'Cause I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no

They warned me
Oh yes they all warned me
They told me now don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back, no no
Oh it's too late
She made a big mistake
It wouldn't be the first one anyway
Tell me how many more, no no no

No I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can try all she wants
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no

It's over
Oh oh it's all over
And it's been a long time coming
Some say it's too long, oh oh
They warned me
Yes they all warned me
They told me, now don't lose your heart to her
She'll never give it back, no no, no no

I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can cry all she wants
She's not gonna get me back, no no
I don't wanna know (what she said)
No I don't wanna know (what she said)
She can try all she wants
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
No no, no
No no no

One more night
One more night

I've been trying for so long, to let you know,
Let you know how I feel
So if I stumble and if I fall, just help me back,
So I can make you see

Please give me one more night,
Give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

I've been sitting here so long, just wasting time,
Just staring at the phone
And always wondering, should I call you,
Then I thought, but maybe you're not alone

Oh please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,
Give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Like a river to the sea,
I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you

To give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
You know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Ah give me just one more night,
Give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,
Oh give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
And nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
"I'm never coming back", I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Searchin' through the day and into the night
They wouldn't stop until they found him
They didn't know him and they didn't understand, they never asked him why
"Get out of my way", I heard a shout, then a blinding light
All I could see was him running down the street
Out of the shadows and into the night

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Don't give up, keep running, keep hiding
Now don't give up, oh Billy, if you know you're right
Don't give up, 'cause you know that I am on your side
Don't give up, oh Billy
You'd better, you'd better, you'd better run for your life

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

They came at night leaving fear behind, shadows were on the ground
Nobody knew where to find him, no evidence was found
I'm never coming back, I heard him cry, and I believe him
He never meant to do anything wrong, it's gonna get worse if he waits too long

Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

I know she says she wants me, I hear it every day
And I know she knows it keeps me, well there ain't no other way
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would

She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me
She fills me full of lovin', oh, then she sets me free
But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would

I'm not the only one, but I'll do fine
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind
I don't own her and I never could
Don't think I do, don't think I should

Tell me, who said I would (who said I would)
Who said I would

But she's got a heart, must be made of stone
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
You're not the only one, but you'll do fine
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind
You don't own me and you never could
Don't think you do, don't think you should
Who said I would (who said I would)

Now she knows when she calls me, I'll come running every time
And she knows she gets me hot, and she'll know it's her body, not her mind
And she's got a heart, must be made of stone
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone, she says
Who said I would
Tell me, who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would
Who said I would

You keep on walking so you don't fall down
It's the same old story
You keep on hiding so you can't be found
It's the same old story
Oh but I know you, you're the one who ran
You know why, it's because you can, oh
It's all right, 'cause I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

My friends keep falling and they can't get up
It's the same old story
Well one says white and the other one black
It's the same old story
And I don't know why you keep emotions walled up
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up
But it's all right, 'cause I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

Things can change, from a misunderstanding
Nobody talks, nobody hears, oh oh oh
Makes me wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

You keep on looking for that higher ground
It's the same old story
Your glass is empty and the chips are down
It's the same old story
But I don't know why, your emotions walled up
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up
But it's all right, 'cause I don't mind
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why

Doesn't anybody stay together anymore
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

Well, I'm running down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can 
Don't even try to understand 
Just find a place to make your stand 
And take it easy 

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see 
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well, I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe 
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

Oh we got it easy 
We oughta take it easy

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Raven hair and ruby lips
Sparks fly from her finger tips
Echoed voices in the night
She's a restless spirit on an endless flight

Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

She held me spellbound in the night
Dancing shadows and firelight
Crazy laughter in another room
And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon

Woo hoo witchy woman, see how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman, she got the moon in her eye

Well I know you want a lover
Let me tell you brother, she's been sleeping in the Devil's bed
There's some rumors going round, someone's underground
She can rock you in the nighttime till your skin turns red

Woo hoo witchy woman
See how high she flies
Woo hoo witchy woman
She got the moon in her eye

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You scare me a bit,
But that's all right
You know when I want you
Most every night
And I've been meaning to tell
You baby that it makes no sense
Still I'm finally convinced
Yeah yeah
I believe we could chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove
Is right you're so much woman I
Believe we could chug all night
On the day that I die, well
I just might scream
If I'm alive in the morning
I'll be alive in a dream
You better listen to me baby
Cause you know that I'm hung on you
Till I'm blind and black and blue
No one else will do
I do believe we chug all night
I believe we could hug all night
The band is loose and the groove is right
You're so much woman I believe
We could chug all night
No woman ever do what you do
High on a pleasure wheel
No devil ever cast a voodoo
So long and dark and real
We're gonna do a little chugging
We're gonna do a little hugging
The band is loose and the groove is right
I'm wired for sound
Are you wired for light?
And you're so much woman,
I believe we could chug all night
I said a yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Woo! It's only midnight baby
Come on and do it to me

Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?
Tell me scarlet sun
What will time allow?
We have brought our children
Here Who can save them now?
Oh, Weeping woman try to smile
Like the coming dawn
Most of us are sad it's true
Still we must go on
Love was here today
Oh the sun was bright
I will sing you faraway
Love is here tonight
Most of us are sad
No one lets it show
I've been shadows of myself
How was I to know?

I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby
Just want to let them roll
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy
I'll tell you why
I got a woman who can take me there
The apple of my eye
Oh, I just don't know, no no, no, no
I love her so
Don't let me see that morning paper
'Cause I don't need those dues
It's just the same old murder movie
But they call it the news
I'll tell you what would be some story
And what would set me free
Is if the same thing happened to everybody
That just happened to me, oh,
I just don't know, no, no, no, no
I'll never let her go
Every time I hear somebody sneakin'
Up behind whoa, I turn around
But I still hear that sound
And just when I'm about to lose my mind
Here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way down along that devastation trail
Well tell the Lord above
She's got a brand of love
That cannot fail
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind
That's no lie
I'm hanging on to my special friend
The apple of my eye
My inspiration, too
She's got a lead on my heart and
My soul and she knows just what to do
Oh, I just don't know, no, no, no, no
No, I get so low, and my mind's about to go
But wait a minute, here comes my baby
Singing like a nightingale
Coming my way down along that devastation trail
Well, let the fires burn, let the floods return
We will prevail
Hanging on to my peace of mind
I just don't know

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I lost ten points just for being in the right place
At exactly the wrong time
I looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have
Been completely blind
So, if you see me walking all alone
Don't look back, I'm just on my way back home
There's a train leaves here this morning, and
I don't know, what I might be on
She signed me to a contract, baby said it would
All be so life long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't something more to blame it on
But, if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now, and I won't be hanging on
There's a train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on
1320 North Columbus was the address
That I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was getting time to leave
And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said, "Lead on"
Cause there's a train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on
And there's train leaves here this morning
And I don't know, what I might be on

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Open up your eyes 
Take the devil from your mind 
He's been holding on to you 
And you're so hard to find 
The wind outside is cold 
Restless feeling in my soul 
Tempting me to get away 
But there's no place a man can go 
God, will you lead me where I roam? 
Help me not to let my feelings show 
No, No You are the one, oh, how could you be so blind? 
The devil prays on runaways 
He's never far behind 
The many years I've tried 
Now have been revealed to me 
Closer is the love you'll find 
Waiting so patiently 
God, Will you lead me where I roam? 
Help me not to let my feelings show. 
NO, NO 
Take the devil 
Take the Devil 
From your mind

Early in the morning
About the break of day
The earlybird is working
So his life don't fade away
Spends his life denying that
He's got no time for flying
In the breeze
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone
And he is free
Earlybird is scratching though
The going's getting tough
Time is passing by him and he just
Can't get enough
He'll tell you all is well when
All is really going wrong
The Earlybird will wake one day
And find his life is gone
You know I like to lay in bed
And sleep out in the sun
Reading books and playing crazy music
Just for fun
You know it makes feel so fine
And puts my mind at ease to
Know that I don't harm a soul
In doing what I please
Ah, ah, ah ah...
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away
Any old day you say,
Ain't gonna fade away

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I wanna sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a million stars all around

'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I think you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
But she can't take you anyway
You don't already know how to go

'Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I bet you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

I get this feeling I may know you
As a lover and a friend
But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again

And I get a peaceful easy feeling
And I'm sure you won't let me down
'Cause I'm already standing
Oh, I'm already standing
Well, I'm already standing 
Yes, I'm already standing on the ground

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm just arriving in the city
And there's music on my mind
Lookin' for my destination and
My home is far behind
'Cause it's a long road ahead
And you can make it in the end
And I'm gonna make it with my friends
And I'm tryin'
It took me sometime to see it
Now I'm looking through this world
And it's gonna take some time before
I get back, help me girl
'Cause you can make it if you try
You gotta lay it on the line
And everything will be fine if you try
Sittin' smokin' just a thinkin'
Is an easy thing to do
We gotta keep on trying for
The feelin' to come through
And it's a lonely way to live
You gotta take it, you gotta live
If you mistake it, just try again
And I'm trying, yeah!
Got to keep on trying
Ah, we got to keep on trying
Yeah I'm trying...

They were doolin', Doolin-Dalton.
High or low, it was the same,
Easy money and faithless women,
Red-eye whiskey for the pain.

Go down, Bill Dalton, it must be God's will,
Two brothers lyin' dead in Coffeyville,
Two voices call to you from where they stood.
Lay down your law books now,
They're no damn good.

Better keep on movin', Doolin-Dalton,
Till your shadow sets you free
And If you're fast, and if you're lucky,
You will never see that hangin' tree.

Oh the towns lay out across the dusty plains
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin'
For the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir crazy lord cause
Nothin' ever changed

Till Bill Doolin' met Bill Dalton
He was working cheap, just bidin' time
And then he laughed and said I'm goin'
And so he left that peaceful life behind...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Twenty-one and strong as I can be 
I know what freedom means to me 
And I can't give the reason why 
I should ever want to die 
Got no cause to be afraid 
Or fear that life will ever fade 
'Cause as I watch the rising sun 
I know that we have just begun 

I might spend my life upon the road 
Just tryin' to add to what I know 
Then someday I might settle down 
And all my friends will be around 

They say a man should have a stock and trade 
But me, I'll find another way 
I believe in getting what you can 
And there ain't no stoppin' this young man 

Because I'm you and fast as I can be 
I know what freedom means to me 
And I can't give the reason why, 
I should ever want to die 
No I can't give the reason why 
I should ever want to die

Oh, my, don't the sky look spacious
With the stars all shinin' down
Well, I can hear the night wind howlin'
It's a high and lonesome sound
And I ain't had a woman in so long
I can't feed my starvin soul
Come on, saddle up, boys, we're gonna ride into town
We're gonna get a little out of control

There's a card game in the corner
And the barmaid smiled at me
Well, I tipped her a sliver dollar and
She brought me a drink for free

All the town-folk call her the cheap one
And the gamblers call her Flo
Come on, set 'em up again
I got me a friend and I think I'm gettin' out of control
Oh, oh, oh

She's cool water, her momma taught her
I got news, she's mine and mine alone
And if anybody's lookin' for trouble
You know I'm the one you want to try

Well, I'll fight any man who wants to
And I don't care who or why

You got to gamble on your story
You got no guts, you get no glory
And I'm bettin' my money on an ace in the hole
Think I'm gettin' out of control

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's another tequila sunrise
Stirrin slowly across the sky
I said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' round

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Oh and it's a hollow feelin'
When it comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise
And this old world still looks the same
Another frame

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the Queen of Diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the Queen of Hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh, freedom
Well, that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime?
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the nighttime from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
Come down from your fences
Open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(Let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

He was a poor boy, raised in a small family
He kinda had a craving for somethin' no one else could see
They say that he was crazy,
The kind that no lady should meet
He ran out to the city and wandered around in the street
He wants to dance, oh yeah,
He wants to sing, oh yeah,
He wants to see the lights a flashin' and listen
To the thunder ring

He saw it in a window
The mark of a new kind of man
He kinda liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand
He took it to the country and practiced for days without rest
And then one day he felt if,
He knew he could stand with the best

They got respect, oh yeah,
He wants the same, oh yeah,
And it's a certain kind of fool who
Like to hear the sound of his own name
Ooh...

A poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man
He had a reputation spreading like fire throught the land
It wasn't for the money, at least it didn't start that way
It wasn't for the runnin', but now he's runnin' everyday

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I am an outlaw, I was born an outlaw's son
The highway is my legacy
On the highway I will run
In one hand I've a Bible
In the other I've got a gun
Well, don' you know me
I'm the man who won
Woman don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man

First left my woman, it was down in Santa Fe
Headed for Oklahoma, I was ridin' night and day
All of my friends are strangers
They quickly come and go

And all my love's in danger
'Cause I steal hearts and souls
Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man
Ooh...

Woman, don't try to love me
Don't try to understand
A life upon the road is the life of an outlaw man

Some me call me Abel
Some men call me Cain
Some men call me sinner, Lord
Some men call me saint

Some say there's a Jesus
Some men say there ain't
When you got no life to lose
Then there's nothin' left to gain
Outlaw man
Outlaw man

Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring
The bluebird was high on the wing

Whatever happened to Saturday night
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
She said,"Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

The years brought the railroad
It ran by my door
Now there's boards on the windows
And dust on the floor
And she passes the time at another man's side
And I pass the time with my pride

What a tangled web we weave
Go 'round with circumstance
Someone show me how to tell the dancer
From the dance

What ever happened
To Saturday night?
Choosin' a friend and losin' a fight
She said,"Tell me, oh, tell me, are you all right?"
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
Whatever happened to Saturday night?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Once I was young and so unsure
I'd try any ill to find the cure
An old man told me
Tryin' to scold me
"Oh, son, don't wade too deep in Bitter Creek,"
(Bitter Creek)

Out where the desert meets the sky
Is where I go when I wanna hide
Oh, peyote (oh, peyote, mm)
She tried to show me (tried to show me)
You know there ain't no cause to weep at Bitter Creek
(Bitter Creek)

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

We're gonna hit the road for one last time
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind
All that money (All that money, ooh..)
No more runnin' (No more runnin')
I can't wait to see the old man's face
When I win the race
(Bitter Creek)

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo...

Well the stage was set the sun was sinkin' low down
As they came to town to face another showdown
The lawmen cleared the people from the streets
All you blood-thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seats?
Watch 'em Duelin', Doolin-Dalton, high or low, it's all the same

Easy money and faithless women, you will never kill the pain
Go down, Bill Doolin, don't you wonder why
Sooner or later we all have to die?
Sooner or later, that's a stone-cold fact
Four men ride out and only three ride back

The queen of diamonds let you down
She was just an empty fable
The queen of hearts you say you never met
Your twisted fate has found you out and it' finally turned the tables
Stole your dreams and paid you with regret
Desperado (is there gonna be anything left, is there gonna be anything?)
You sealed your fate up a long time ago
(Ain't it hard when you're all alone in the center ring?)
Now there's no time left to borrow
(Is there gonna be anything left?)
Only stardust (maybe tomorrow)
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe tomorrow

Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado
Desperado

Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day 
And they said you were gonna put me on a shelf 
But let me tell you I got some news for you 
And you'll soon find out it's true 
And then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself 

'Cause I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this victory song
Woo, hoo, hoo, my, my, woo, hoo, hoo 

The letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why 
But I guess you felt like you had to set things right 
Just remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky 
You can see the stars and still not see the light

And I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this vict'ry song
Woo, hoo, hoo, my, my, woo, hoo, hoo 

Well I know it wasn't you who held me down 
Heaven knows it wasn't you who set me free 
So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains 
And we never even know we have the key 

But me, I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this victory song 
'Cause I'm already gone 
Yes, I'm already gone 
And I'm feelin' strong 
I will sing this victory song 
'Cause I'm already gone 
Yes, I'm already gone 
Already gone 
All right, nighty-night

You never cry like a lover should 
Sigh when it feels real good 
Or see the sky through the stone and wood 
You never cry like a lover 

I thought I saw somebody I loved 
Sleeping deep inside you 
If I could catch you in an unguarded moment 
I'd stay right here beside you 

You never smile at me late at night 
Laugh out loud when we get it right 
You can't get loose if there's too much light 
You never smile like a lover 

I can't live with you baby, can't live without it 
And sometimes I believe in love 
Sometimes I doubt it 
But your life goes on 
Like a broken down carousel 
Where somebody left the music on 

You never move like you used to do 
Pour it out when you're feelin' blue 
Somebody must have put some pain on you 
You never cry like a lover 
(You never Cry Like a Lover) 
Cry 
(You never cry like a lover) 
You never cry 
(Cry like a lover) 
Come on and cry 
(You never cry like a lover

Ooh, Midnight Flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Ooh, Midnight Flyer
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on

A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be

Ooh, Midnight Flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Ooh, Midnight Flyer,
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe, maybe San Antone,
Any town is where I'm bound any way to get me gone
Don't think about me, never let me cross your mind
'Cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine

Ooh, Midnight Flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Ooh, Midnight Flyer
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on

Tell me the truth, how do you feel? 
Like you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels? 
Don't feel too bad, you're not all alone 
We're all tryin' to get along 
With ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way 
You're bound to get tripped, and what can you say? 
Just go along 'til they turn out the lights 
There's nothin' we can do to fight it 

No man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain 
And we who must remain go on living just the same 

I once knew a man, very talented guy 
He's sing for the people and people would cry 
They knew that his song came from deep down inside 
You could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes 

And so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone 
Like a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind 
Called him home 

My man's got it made 
He's gone far beyond the pain 
And we who must remain go on living just the same 
We who must remain go on laughing just the same

Cruisin' down the center of a two way street
Wond'rin' who is really in the driver's seat
Mindin' my bus'ness, along comes big brother
Says, "Son, you better get on one side or the other"

I'm out on the border
I'm walkin' the line
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm try'n' to change this water to wine

After a hard day, I'm safe at home
Foolin' with my baby on the telephone
Out of nowhere somebody cuts in
And says, "Hmm, you in some trouble boy, we know where you're been"

I'm out on the border
I thought this was a private line
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm try'n' to change this water to wine

Never mind your name, just give us your number, mm
Never mind your face, just show us your card, mm
And we wanna know whose wing are you under
You better step to the right or we can make it hard

I'm stuck on the border
All I wanted was some peace of mind
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
I'm try'n' to change this water to wine

On the border
On the border
On the border
On the border

(On the border)
Leave me be, I'm just walkin' this line
(I'm out on the border)
(On the border)
All I wanted was some peace of mind, peace of mind
(I'm out on the border)
(On the border)
Can't you see I'm tryin' to change this water to wine?
(I'm out on the border)
(On the border)
Don't you tell me 'bout your law and order
(I'm out on the border)
I'm sick and tired of all your law and order
(On the border)
Say Goodnight, Dick
(I'm out on the border...)

James Dean, James Dean
I know just what you mean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen

You were the lowdown rebel if there ever was
Even if you had no cause
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen

We'll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator
You were just too cool for school
Sock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop
The only thing that got you off was breakin' all the rules
James Dean, James Dean
So hungry and so lean
James Dean, you said it all so clean
And I know my life would look all right
If I could see it on the silver screen

Little James Dean, up on the screen
Wond'rin' who he might be
Along came a Spyder and picked up a rider
And took him down the road to eternity

James Dean, James Dean, you bought it sight unseen

You were too fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
You were to fast to live, too young to die, bye-bye
Bye-bye, Bye-bye, Bye-bye, Bye, bye

Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger

Six in the morning
Gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Now the cars are all passing me
Trucks are all flashing me
I'm headed home from your place

And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishin' I'd stayed a little longer
Lord, don't you know, the feeling's getting stronger

Well, my time went so quickly
I went lickety-splitly
Out to my old '55
As I pulled away slowly
Feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

And now the sun's coming up, yes it is
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck
Freeway, cars and trucks
Riding with Lady Luck

How come you love him when he 
Takes you for a fool 
He's only lookin' for a good time 
How can he love you when he 
Treats you mean and cruel 
He's not the best thing that you could find 
Is it true? 
I can't believe it 
Is it true? 
I just can't see it 
Is it true? 
Is that you? 

When we were young, we didn't really have a care 
You were hung up, I had a good line 
I never knew it then but, man, I was in love 
How could I know it was the right time? 
Is it true? 
You've lost that feelin'? 
Is is true? 
You might be leavin'? 
Is it true? 
Don't wanna find out 

Yes, I was so wrong 
For leading you on 
There wasn't much I could do 

I was a wild one, but I can change some 
If that's important to you 
Is it true- you've lost that feelin'? 
Is it true- you might be leavin'? 
Is it true? 
Is it true? 
She's really leavin' 
She's really leavin'

Move in, 
Can't you see she wants you 
She has you deep in her eyes 
You been wond'rin' why she haunts you 
Beauty in the devil's disguise 
She can tell you all about it 
She sees it in the stars 
She'll burn you if you try to put her down 

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound 

Higher, 
She can keep you loaded, 
Feedin' you whiskey and wine 
Fire, 
The devil's on the phone, he laughs 
And says you're doin' the just fine 
In that big book of names I wanna go down 
In flames 
Seein's how I'm goin' down 

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound 

Truckin', 
That's all that I've been doin' 
Ev'ry girl's a fork in the road 
Stuck in some sticky situations 
Feelin' like I wanna explode 

All this gratification and sick conversation 
Someone get me out of town 
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell 
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

'Cause it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money don't try to save
My heart says go, go
Have a time 'cause it's Saturday night
And I'm feelin' fine

I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up

And ball tonight

I got a date and I won't be late
Pick her up in my '88'
Shag it on down to the union hall
When the music starts jumpin'

Along about 10 I'll be flying high
Rocking on out into the sky
I don't care if I spend my gold
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

Crying over you, dear only

However some day they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

That would shame the stars that shine
My darlin' my darlin'
You were the first in line
When they gave out lips like honey
That hold a new thrill every time
My darlin' my darlin'
You were the first in line

There may be others
That know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But there's no other
Could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do
Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me
I'm yours, oh please be mine
My darlin' say I'm your darlin'
The first, and the last in line

When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotized
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feeling warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed

Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing ev'ry day
Ever since that day you came my way
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning
At night I'm still the same
Do you remember that wonderful time
You held my hand and swore that you'll be mine
In front of preacher you said
"I do" I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed

My baby's long and tall
She's like a cannonball
Say, every time she loves me
Lordly, you can hear me squall
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
Morning, noon, and night
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

When my baby does what she does to me
I climb the highest mountain
Dive in the deepest sea
She cried, ooh-wee
I believe I'll change my mind
She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine
And when she kisses me

She said, "I'm so glad I'm living"
I cried, "I'm so glad you're mine"

When I was a lad
And old Shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

As the years fast did roll
Old Shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him Jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old Shep has a wonderful home

Ready set go man go

Rea-dy rea-dy rea-dy to
Rock 'n' roll

Going down to the corner
Pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock 'n' roll baby
She's the apple of my eye, 'cause

Flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping
The cats are going wild
The music really sends me
I dig that crazy style 'cause

Gonna kick off my shoes
Roll up my faded jeans
Grab my rock 'n' roll baby
Pour on the steam
I shuffle to the left
I shuffle to the right
I'm gonna rock 'n' roll
Till the early early night 'cause

Whether you're riding down a highway
Or walkin' down a street
It makes no difference baby
I'm gonna love you just as mean
'Cause holdin' your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

Whether we're standin' on a doorstep
Or sittin' at a park
Or strollin' down shady lane
Or dancin' in the dark
Well I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

Give me a cave up in the mountain
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven honey
If you are there with me
Well kiss your pretty lips
See the love-light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

Baby I'd live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go be
If you were there with me
Well I could love you all the time
Baby, a jungle would be fine
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?

Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you?

Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away

Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
And I'm asking you darling
How's the world treating you?

How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?

How do you think we stand?
Well, I know you've made your plans
But you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?

I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?

How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The one I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?

How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel?

Well, how do you think we stand?
I know you've made your plans
Another's pretty face
Has put me out of place
How do you think I feel?

I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?

How do you think I feel?
Well, I know your love's not real
And you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel?

Hurts so good, my heart just flips

Never happy 'less she's mad

Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I may do
You know that I'll always be loving you, just you

And, if I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me, and you know who
You know that I'll always be loving you

Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

There's a moon that's big and bright in the milky way tonight
But the way you act you never would know it's there
So baby, time's a wasting
A lot of kisses I ain't been tasting
I don't know about you but I'm gonna get my share

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

There's a balmy little breeze
That's whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up a little closer and be my little honey bee

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting
Why don't you start co-operating
And the things I say are things you want to hear

Oh got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
Come on baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot o' living to do
A whole lot o' loving to do
And there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
I ain't even got a nickel
To call my baby on the phone

Just beyond the mountain lies a city
And I hear it calling me
Saddle up and ride you lonesome cowboy
Here is where you'll find your destiny
In my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star

Ride. ride, ride, ride along cowboy
Sing, sing, sing, sing a song cowboy

Will I ever leave this lonesome valley
Really see the lights that shine
Gotta find what lies beyond the mountain
Gotta rope and tie that dream of mine

I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
If you don't call me baby
Then I'm never coming home

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hot dog, you say you're really coming back
Hot dog, I'm waiting at the railway track
Hot dog, you say you're coming home for good
Hot dog, I'm going to keep knocking on wood
And baby, I can hardly wait
I'm gonna meet you at the gate, hot dog

I fell in love with you and then you went away
But now you're coming home to stay
Hot dog, soon everything will be all right
Hot dog, we're gonna have a ball tonight
I've got a pocketful of dimes
It's gonna be just like old times, hot dog

You went away and every day was misery
But now you're coming back to me
Hot dog, my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog, when you come walking off the train
Oh how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in
Hot dog, baby, baby, hot dog

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I feel it in my leg,
I feel it in my shoe
Tell me pretty baby
If you think you feel it too
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
Send to the store
And let's buy some more
And let's have a party tonight

Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a groovin'
Gonna satisfy my soul

I've never kissed a bear
I've never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of the room

Now Honky Tonky Joe
Is knockin' at the door
Bring him in and fill him up
And set him on the floor

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Tho' we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Suntanned, windblown, honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par, oh how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So, on and on it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel on high
With nothing to do but to give to you
And to give to me love forever true

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Don't leave me now
Now that I need you
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through

Don't break my heart
This heart that loves you
They'll just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now

What good is dreamin'
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you darling
My arms would gather dust

Come to these arms
These arms that need you
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Have I told you lately that I love you? 
Could I tell you once again somehow? 
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you? 
Well darling I'm telling you now 

Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping 
Every dream I dream is you somehow? 
Have I told you why the nights are long 
When you're not with me? 
Well darling I'm telling you now 

My heart would break in two if I should lose you 
I'm no good without you anyhow 
And have I told you lately that I love you 
Well darling I'm telling you now 

My heart would break in two if I should lose you 
I'm no good without you anyhow 
And have I told you lately that I love you 
Well darling I'm telling you now

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I need you so
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on

I need your arms
Around me tightly
Yes, I miss them nightly
When you're not at home

When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock on the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so

When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock on the door

When you leave me
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry
'Cause I need you so

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Every time I look at someone new
Tell me why I think of you
Then you sometimes ask me by
You're playing with love
Darling tell me why

You left me all alone
To cry over you
My heart is torn and broken
There's nothing left to do

In my prayers, I'll mention you
When you're gone I feel so blue
Why can't I have all of you
Oh, somebody, please tell me why

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Oh, if you tell a lie
You know that I'll forgive you
Though you say our love is just a game
And when you hear my name
You'll say I'm from a strange world
But is it so strange to be in love with you

Is it so strange
That I love you more than all the world
Is it so strange
I have no eyes for any other girl

Oh won't you take me back
And say that you still love me
To waste a love like ours would be a sin
Let us kiss again
Let me hold you near
And take me from this strange world
That I'm living in

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide

Always lived, very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

Always lived, very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long

One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You know what it takes,
You've got it, baby.
You are the only one I chose.
Don't leave me here with all these heartaches,
Only you and heaven knows
About my troubles troubles troubles.

When it rains, it really pours...

You shouldn't have took away my loving
You know you thrill me from head to toe.
I got a feeling for you baby
And you're the only one who knows
About my troubles, troubles, troubles.

When it rains, it really pours...

You know what you did to make me love you
You really opened up my nose.
You got what you wanted, now you left me.
That's the way the story goes.
Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles.

When it rains, it really pours.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
So darling please be careful
You know I care a lot
Darling please don't break my heart
I beg of you

I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
I you only say goodbye
Darling please don't say goodbye
I beg of you

Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you little girl

You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Cause you know my love is true
Darling please please love me too
I beg of you

Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you little girl

You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Cause you know my love is true
Darling please please love me too
I beg of you

Jennifer lost the war today
You'll find her burned and raped
Through it all
She must have wondered
What have I done
But nobody really cares today
The world's a busy place
Guess she must have really sinned

I guess we're all just soldiers
She was only six years old
Left to die by strangers
Her family waits
And if we're all just soldiers
Is it so wrong to be afraid

Phoebe lost the war today
There must be some mistake
Say it happens all the time
And it's said and done
And Little Miss 1565 Your soul remains unclaimed
Guess you must have really sinned

Morality won't help her
When she lies silent in a morgue
And all our sorrows just don't count at all
But will the morning headlines
Even say that it's a shame
What are we headin' for

Seen it all before
Silent on the ground
As he's walking away
And I wonder how many more
Everybody takes it
Like it's nothing at all
Jennifer lost the war

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When we younger
There always seemed like
Some perfect mold
That we're supposed to be
But now we're growing up and
I see it's just not that way
Now I feel like someone's lied to me

'Cause I've been true
Made good for you
And now I feel used
I'm asking you
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be like you

Tell me now elders
What were your reasons for
Making it seem
Like you were so much more
If you want to feel good
Because of our accomplishments
Why the fuck
Don't you just do it yourself

'Cause I've tried
Man I've tried
While you all lied
So now just tell me
How does it feel
How does it feel

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Look at my soldier boy now
With that big gun in your little hand
As you patrol this foreign land
Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet

Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time

As you sit here all alone
Will your buddies come and save your life
But as the enemy appears
See your life flash before your eyes

Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time

Now do you see the light
Fading while your world is crumbling
Out on patrol
And all you can do is sit and stare
What revelation have you now
What culmination to your speck of life
Your moment in time

It's your life
It's your life
It's your life

It's your life
It's your life
It's your life

Uno, dos, tres, quatro

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Time has washed away
And now I may wonder
How did it all slip by
'Cause I always thought
We had forever
Future calls to me
To take me away from things
I don't want to leave behind
Like I'm slipping away
I can't hold on

Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home

Find that path alone
Crossroads lead me away
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home

Through it all
My mind still wanders
To the one who touched my soul
Though her road leads away
She's still my
True love
I could believe

Will is not enough when all those
Lost days stand in the way
But she was
My hopes and dreams my
Whole world
I could believe

I still want to know
Who can see for me
Crossroads tell me

Now you'll have to trade
Your past away
And find another day
So is change a friend or an enemy

Through what comes to pass
I'll find my way
I've seen it all before
But is the best you can be
The best thing to be
Some people say
You're just wasting time
But that's not what worries me
I just want to know what's home

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Clouds pass over the moon
Like an eye that shows impending doom
Tension in this misty air
Souls pass into the room
Drawn in by a lost memory
You will join them in the moonlight

You are my offering
Your soul transcends
The centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in death

Time passes like the wind
As we race to beat days dusky grin
Mornings just a moment away
Your body glistens in candlelight
As we all look on in fiendish delight
The ritual is just beginning

Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
As virgins and spectres sing
This madness will never cease

In the dead of night
You will follow
In the footsteps of many others
Who have come before
I will show you the altar
Your Aztec eyes, Egyptian hair
Your beauty bestowed upon my lair
I've loved you before, in other lives
But you've never meant as much to me
Never meant as much to me as now

In this night of sacrifice
Where blood is spilt
That will never spill again
But in your linen robes
We want you now
We want you now
You could never ask for more than that

You are my offering
Your soul transcends
The centuries of pain
Your misery in life
Is your ecstasy in
Come fulfill the prophecy
With our demons of debauchery
This madness will never cease

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Mommy doesn't have a head any more
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor
Well that's alright, that's OK
She never really used her head anyway

Daddy called me a silly bore
Bet he won't say that any more
Because the way his body is severed too
His vocal chords are gonna be hard to use

Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

Watch my girl friend come to the door
Chop off her head, she falls to the floor
Now watching my baby's jugular blow
Really makes my motor go

Wrap a towel round the bloody stump
Take my baby's body to the city dump
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe
Scoop all the heads into my burlap sack

Beheaded, watch her spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

All my collection, adorns my room on bamboo poles
Use to be a little, but a little got more and more
Now I'm craving yours

Night brings bad dreams, bad dreams and guillotines

Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head
Off with her head

Find another victim for my machine
Put him in a home-made guillotine
Blade falls, gonna need a casket
Watch your head plop in a wicker basket

Leave the house at a quarter to four
Come back with sixteen or more
Cause the more I walk, the more I see
I got a funny feeling coming over me

Beheaded, watch you spurt like a garden hose
Beheaded, bloody mess all over my clothes

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

In your plane in the blue sky
You roam again
Words that echo in your mind
Make your heart beat faster
This is no Vietnam
We will win in Iran

The President said let it ride
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Warrior, the time bombs
About to go
What will you feel
Will you even wonder
If the man that's in your sights
Ever kissed his girl goodbye

The Captain said kill or die
Islam be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

Great Satan
Our flags our burning

Soon America may find
Its young men in the sand
Where their casualty
Is just a number
In Iran

The President said let it ride
You will be damned
Make your last stand
In Tehran

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you
I'll tell you no lies
When all is said and done
Does it really matter who's wrong or right
Don't ask me for a reason, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
As I lie bleeding here I still
I still reach for you

A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes

Your eyes are open now but you know
It's still hard to see inside
When action and intention
Are two separate things
Now I somehow wish I could explain
Why we hurt each other again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you

A thousand days
Have passed away
A thousand days
Were captured in her eyes

Forever we've been
Trapped by our hearts
Trapped by our minds
I'd like to leave
I'd like to win at love

But I just can't let it go
And I just can't watch it slipping away
And I just can't let it go
And I just can't stand another minute

Maybe now someday our shattered live
Will mend themselves again
But now a million miles away
I still wish I could
And though I somehow know, I can't explain
Why we hurt one another again and again
Like someone on his dying breath
I still reach for you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

In this world of hate and shallowness
Where enemies become your consolation
And those of us who win the game give up our minds
I don't call that winning
Say this doesn't apply to you
But ask yourself first
What have I done today to win the game
And just what have I sacrificed

Win the battle lose the war
I know I've played this game before
When people were still real
I don't want this anymore
It's time for me to close the door
There's nothing left to feel

Reflect on all our yesterdays
My own words choke me
Why were they spoken
Regret for the things I've said and done
Just can't compare with
Regret for those that I have never tried
So blame this world or blame yourself
It's really all the same
When you are standing on the precipice
From which you just cannot return

Win the battle or lose the war
I know I've played this game before
When people were still real
I don't want this anymore
It's time for me to close the door
There's nothing left to feel

In the style of forgotten men
I look to my horizon
I see nothing
While thoughts of guns and desecration
Sweep through my mind
But only coffins and bones remain
As I look to you
The emptiness behind your eyes
Seals my decision
Can't carry on in this world of jugglers
Where all this thoughtlessness and bludgeonings
Your key to success
What kind of tradition to carry on

Blackball The new disease
Blackball The new disease
Blackball Your evil ways
Have found their way inside me

Blackball The new disease
Blackball The new disease
Blackball For a better life
In this high tech dog eat dog existence

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Once I had a friend that I could count on
So I thought
Well so it seemed
But times of need are not enough
To prove your friendship to me now
Once I saw a face that I believed in
But a mask was all there was
So who wears the masks and who wears the faces
Well I guess I'll never know

But as I stand here alone in a room full of people
With nothing to say
Beer on their minds, and smoke in the air
Call them friends but they just don't care

Friend for life
Such shallow words for broken minds
Show me a friend for life
'Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive
When I'll feel alive
I'll be waiting for that day

Once I found a love I had to know
Now we might know each other just too well
'Cause when we're together we just can't get enough
Or is it we just can't get what we want
Once I saw a dream, I had to chase it
Dreams quickly turn to reality
Who's at fault in this game of yours and mine
Well I guess I'll never know

But as I sit here alone
Think of the girl who came softly inside me
The look in her eyes, the smell of her hair
Call her my own but is she really there?

Love for life
Such noble words for noble minds
Show me a love for life
'Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive
When I'll feel alive
I'll be waiting for that day

Once I had a friend that I could count
Times of need are not enough
Once I found a love I had to know
Now we might know each other just too well
Once I saw a dream I had to chase
Dreams quickly turn to reality
Now let me close my eyes
Because I don't want to see anything anymore

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

Kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy

In a world without leaders
Who'd make people starve?
The world that we're saving
Will always be ours

Everyone says, well maybe I'll make a difference
Thinking they've got plenty of time
But you're squeezed a little tighter everyday
Punished before you can commit a crime

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

Kill the president, listen to the voice of reason
Unify with that single line
Stop the man with the power of the government
A leader's not the center of democracy

America, all of your enemies come from within
But you lash out so it is seen like some frightened child
In an angry world or the fall of Rome
Your demise comes from your own hands

In a world without leaders
Who'd start all the wars?
The world that you're saving
Will always be yours

In a world without leaders
We might have a chance
But we'll never see it
As long as there's

Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president
Kill the president now!

I've been told that to get what you want
You just gotta give what you can
But I know for what I want it don't come easy as that
They say, "Look out, boy
Tomorrow comes and things will look better by then."
But I'll look out the window
Then look in the mirror at the same old me again 

Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never will 

Do you think you'd sell your soul
To just have one thing to turn out right?
For the thousandth time you turn and find
That it just makes no difference to try
Like Holden Caulfield, I tell myself
There's got to be a better way
Then I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
Dream of brighter days 

Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never will 

No way out
Same old stuff always drags me down
No way out
Never gonna get it 

Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never
Never never never never get it

Hey Joe, 
Where you goin' with that gun in your hand? 
Hey Joe,

Said I'm gonna go down to shoot my old lady 
I caught her messing around on me, 

Hey Joe, 
I heard that you shot your old lady down,
Hey Joe, 
I heard you caught your old lady fucking some other guy and you shot her down

Well you know, I guess that's true
I guess you can say I shot her her down
Yes I did, I shot her down
I took out my gun, 
Then I shot her down!

Hey Joe, 
Where you gonna run to now? 
Hey Joe, 
Where you gonna run to now? 
Where you gonna go? 

Ain't no hangman gonna, 
Get a rope around me, 
Ain't no hangman gonna, 
Get a rope around me. (no one gonna) 

Goin' way down south, 
Way down to Mexico way 
Goin' way down south, 
Way down where I can be free

Ah, fuck! Fuck fuck fuck!

I don't know when it got this way
I don't know how long she's gonna stay
Every week it's the same
In her room, that's why I came

Here I go, I go again
Our rendezvous never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session

I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)
I'll never see (session)
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold
Got a, got a hold on me

Some might say it's a fling
For all I know it don't mean a thing
Either way I can't complain
Ain't no strings, guess I got it made

Here I go, I go again
The little things never seem to end
I know where I'll be, make this confession
In her bed for another goddamn session

I'll never learn (session)
God knows I try (session)
Keep coming back for session
And I don't know why (session)
I'll never learn (session)

We are one with ourselves
Don't give a shit about no one else
Well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop
The walls come tumbling down

We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct

We are one, you know it's true
Don't fuck with us, or we'll fuck with you
It's a mentality that kills the best, we better stop
The walls come tumbling down

We are one, we are free
We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct

We are one, it won't be news
Hang ourselves with one collective noose
Well, it won't be long until your sun is gonna stop

We are headed for obscurity
We are one, we are weak
We are gonna make ourselves extinct

Hey you're a riddle
I say as I move aside
Like I really need your advice
But you won't leave it alone
Little men try but don't get a lot done
Living in sin doesn't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague
Like I said before
Little men come when anything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away

Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright

Hey, everybody's supposed to be the same
So how come they're so lame?
It's like taking a fall
Keep on running back into that wall
Awake in a dream, get up and go to work
But I'm feeling like such a jerk
Like I said before
Little men come when everything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away

Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright

So you're a riddle
I say as I move aside
Like I really need your advice
But you won't leave it alone
Little men try but don't get a lot done
Living in sin don't move me either way
I get a feeling you're so vague
Like I said before
Little men come when anything goes

When the rain comes I sit home and pray
Make it all numb - I wish it all away
All I really need is just somewhere to hide away

Kick him when he's down
Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright

Here alone I'll put up and fight
Kick him when he's down
Beat me all the way I'll take it all night
Kick him when he's down
Hey don't worry, I'll get along home alright

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When you won't go along
Some will feel like you can't find your way
Heaven knows
Heaven knows I've seen it all before

Now don't get me wrong
I've seen many a life gone astray
When someone goes
All your bows won't make it any better so let it go 

Shut up and take it like a man
You need us to get a life
For your own good we'll take you by the hand
'Cause you need a little more 

Maybe no one will say it
Maybe no one's aware it goes on
All I know
All I know it's like going off the deep end

Could you make a decision?
Could you think for yourself and go on?
Everyone knows
Everyone knows you've got to fit into the mainstream so save your woes 

Shut up and take it like a man
You need us to get a life
For your own good we'll take you by the hand
'Cause you need a little more 

Close your eyes
Look away now
Make believe while you can

So you'd best go along
Don't let on if you can't find your way 
Many more
Many more do it for you
Because heaven knows
Heaven knows it's like playing with fire
Your life's a throw

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I've been told that to get what you want
You just gotta give what you can
But I know for what I want it don't come easy as that
They say, "Look out, boy
Tomorrow comes and things will look better by then."
But I'll look out the window
Then look in the mirror at the same old me again 

Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never will 

Do you think you'd sell your soul
To just have one thing to turn out right?
For the thousandth time you turn and find
That it just makes no difference to try
Like Holden Caulfield, I tell myself
There's got to be a better way
Then I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling
Dream of brighter days 

Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never will 

No way out
Same old stuff always drags me down
No way out
Never gonna get it 

Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
Still can't get it right
And for all I know
I swear I never
Never never never never get it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

In my own simple way
I think she wants me only
She said "Come over right away."
But she's just not that way
Her little soul is stolen
See her put on her brand new face

Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic

I should know better than
To think I'd reach inside her
It's all a cloudy kind of daze
She's not so sweet today
She mocks me, I'm no fighter
It all just seems like such a waste

Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic

It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified
It's oversimplified

Pull the shades
Razor blades
You're so tragic
I hate you so
But love you more
I'm so elastic
The things you say
Games you play
Dirty magic

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When you're feeling low
Hypodermic's where you go
When you're with yourself
You wish you could be someone else 

Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore

When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away 

Once you get a ride
Doesn't matter where you lied
Once you shoot it in
Doesn't matter who you've been

Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore

When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away 

You're reaching in
But you don't know where to begin
All your dance and song
Won't matter when you're gone

Can't you see like you saw anymore
Can't you feel like you felt before
Can't you face anything anymore

When life's a waste
Run away
Your life's a waste
Run away
Run away
Run away
Run away

Run away

I think I'm burning up inside
I think I'll take a little ride
I'm gonna light up everything in sight
I'll drive on by your yard
And throw a Molotov cocktail at your car
Then another in the local bar

Ignition
They call it an obsession
I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

Tonight this 'hood will be a pyre
I'm gonna set your house on fire
I'll dance around the pretty flames
Such a wonderful game

I want to make a tiki torch
I'm gonna throw it on your porch
Then I'm gonna run away
And come back another day

Ignition
They call it an obsession
I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro

So many houses, so little time
So many reasons, I'm not a crime
I'd like to set you up
I'd like to set you up

Ignition
They call it an obsession
I think it's kinda bitchin'
I think it's kinda neat
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
I wanna burn it up
Yeah, I'm a pyro
Yeah, I'm a pyro
Yeah, I'm a pyro

Once you said you'd stick to it until the end
I guess you lied, they call it suicide
Now you're gone
What was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on
Second guess
Did I do my best
There was a friend I had

Johnny was a weirdo so 
What did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself 

I should have known, you went through it alone
I wonder why. Did you even try?
You could have come to me
I would have helped you see
You could have found a way to carry on
Second guess
Did I do my best
There was a friend I had

Johnny was a weirdo so
What did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself

'Johnny's strange behavior
Was a tip-off,' they say
But I ain't no fucking savior
I'm just living day by day

Little things, little lives hanging 'til the end
I say it doesn't really mean nothing
Telling truth, telling lies
I used to have a friend
I say it don't really mean nothing
And I can't let this feeling go
Let this feeling go
Let this feeling go
Let this, let it go

Once you said you'd stick to it until the end
I guess you lied, they call it suicide
Now you're gone
What was so wrong that you couldn't find a way to carry on
Second guess
Did I do my best
There was a friend I had

Johnny was a weirdo so
What did you expect?
I ain't no fucking hero
I'm just trying to survive myself

'Johnny's strange behavior
Was a tip-off,' they say
But I ain't no fucking savior
I'm just living day by day

When cops are taking care of business I can understand
But the L.A. story's gone way out of hand
Their acts of aggression, they say they're justified
But it seems an obsession has started from the inside

They're shooting anyone who even tries to run
They're shooting little kids with toy guns
Take it to a jury but they don't give a damn
Because the one who tells the truth is always the policeman 

Beat all the niggers
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
(We're) L.A.P.D. 

The city of L.A. feels like a prison 
With helicopters overhead and bullets whizzing by
Martial law ain't no solution
Police brutality's just social pollution 

Beat all the white trash
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
(We're) L.A.P.D. 

They say they're keeping the peace but I'm not buying it
Because a billy club ain't much of a pacifier
"Protecting your freedom", man, that's just a lie
It's an excuse for power that's more like an alibi

Law and order doesn't really matter
When you're the one getting bruised and battered
You take it to a jury, they'll throw it in your face
Because justice in L.A. comes in a can of mace now

Beat all the niggers
Beat whoever you see
Don't need a reason
L.A.P.D.
L.A.P.D.
L.A.P.D.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Things are coming down on me
They never seem to let it be
It seems like everything I say just starts another fight
The pressure's building up inside
I gotta let it out tonight
Shattered glass will cure my ills and make me feel alright

Gonna break it
And never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something

Cut me for the lion's share
It's mindless, but I don't care
'Cause no matter what I say I'm in another fight
Take more shit, I've had enough
Tonight I'm gonna rip it up
Broken windows cure my ills and make me feel alright

Gonna break it 
And never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something

Gonna break it 
And never stop running
Making nothing from something
Making nothing from something

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Look at me while I look at you
Seeing eye to eye we can never do
You try to tell me what is right
I may not know a lot but I know one thing 

If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just keep it your own 

I wonder why our world is ablaze
Sometimes I speak aloud to hear what people have to say
I try to have an open mind
But your brain and mouth must not be connected 

If you've got the answer
Then I don't want to know
If you've got the answer
Just leave me alone 

I would be patient but it takes so long
I don't want all this misinformation
All the words that you say
Lean on me while I lean on you
If we destroy each other
We might save a life or two
A little sun, a little shine
Separates us both by forever and a day 

If you've got a vision
Then I don't want to see
If you've got a notion
Don't waste it on me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Ah, it's time to relax
You know what that means
A glass of wine, your favorite easy chair
And of course, this compact disc
Playing on your home stereo

So, go on, and indulge yourself!
That's right, kick off your shoes
Put your feet up!
Lean back and just enjoy the melodies
After all, music soothes even the savage beast

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all

And live like there's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow

We are the ones
Who are living under the gun, everyday
You might be gone before you know

So live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)

Hey, believe it
The official view of the world has changed
In a whole new way
Live fast 'cause if you don't take it 
You'll never make it

So if you understand me
And if you feel the same
Then you will know what nitro means

You'll live like there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow!

Hey man, you know I'm really OK
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
'Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off; it makes me insane

Open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh ooh oh

They say the road's a dangerous place
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
You drive on my ass
Your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last

'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease, something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit goddamn motherfucker!

I open the glove box
Reach inside
Gonna wreck this fucker's ride
'Cause I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away, yeah, yeah
I got a bad habit, yeah, yeah
And it ain't goin' away, yeah, yeah

Starry sky, oh starry sky
Tell me if you can
Why do all you favors fall?
Is this in your plan?

Every hour of every day
She'll await for you
She'll await a thousand years
And save herself for you

Bible man, oh bible man
Tell me if you know
Why do all the straighter vein
Wreck upon the shore?

Every hour of every day
She'll await for you
She'll await a thousand years
And save herself for you

Her love is like the sea
Crushing endlessly

Every hour of every day
She'll await for you

Every hour of everyday

And save herself for you

Her love is like the sea

I can't believe this world is gonna die

And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time

I said you'd never care
I can't believe this world is gonna end

And why can't you get me on the line?

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile isn't all that great
My fashion sense is a little whack
Got nothin' in my pocket

I didn't go to boardin' schools
Preppie girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothin' in my pocket

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between

I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
'Cause I'm the next big thing

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills

The truth is I don't stand a chance
It's somethin' that you're born into
And I just don't belong

No I don't
I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Beverly Hills

I thought that he was cool.
I thought that he was strong
And then one day he proved me wrong.
He said he felt one way, but acted like another,
He just wanted to fit in.
Bobby no morals (bobby no morals lost his edge)
He was all along
And he couldn't resist,
The temptation was to strong,
Now hes all alone
Trying hard not to look back
'Cause if he does he might regret.
Bobby no morals (bobby no morals lost his edge)

You want it
You got it

You flaunt it and
Get your feet on the ground
And love me right now

You like it
You hate it

You bought it and
Glued your butt to the sound
And love me right now

You couldn't change the world
To fit your little thing, ah... uh

You couldn't change the world
To fit your little thing, ah

Go with the flow
It's the morning after
Don't pick on, don't pick on me

'Cause I don't believe in a burn like that
I pick up my donuts for free
And when she come 'round her picture captures me

So get with the groove
'Cause it hurts me so bad
Don't trifle, don't stifle me

'Cause I don't expect to be torn to shreds
Every time I am in need
And when she comes 'round her picture captures me

And when she comes around
Her (???) joins the sound
Whoa whoa-oa
Whoa-oa-oa

I don't expect to be torn to shreds
Every time I am in need
And when she comes 'round her picture captures me... me

And when she comes around
Her (???) joins the sound
Whoa whoa-oa

Ev'ry night when I go out to the clubs
The wrong way is the only way that I rub

I stand there oh so still
I must be on some pill
'Cause no one wants to see that I'm alive

Ev'ry night when I go out to the bars
People think that I just came down from Mars

I don't say anything
This is why I sing
To get these stupid feelings off my chest

Ev'ry night when I go out chasing chicks
I drop a line, but nothing seems to stick

I fumble for my shoes
I sing the white-boy blues
A ghetto sucka gets some other dates

I don't say anything
This is why I sing
To get these stupid feelings off my chest

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hey, Neighbour
Can you give me the time?
It always feels like it's rock-thirty in my mind
Are you up for it?
Are you ready to run?
Turn it out and shout your way through the next song

I am only happy when it's possible

Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh

Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh
(Let's go!)

Don't matter
Any time, any day
Just come for fun and all will be okay
Poindexter
Nothing to figure out
Every line can rock so stop worrying about

I am only happy when it's possible

Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh

Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh

I am listening for a spark
Hold yourself for the good part
I am listening
'Cause I want to hear a hitch
I want to hear it quick
We're all diving in it
Right here, listening (?)
I am listening

(Ha!)

Commotion
Fills up all of the space
Don't you know I won't show if I've got my own place
'Cause I want to hear a hitch
I want to hear it quick
Hell, you can rest assured
Hey, neighbour

I am only happy when it's possible

Fifteen minutes to rock
It only takes
Ten minutes to rock
It only takes
Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh

Fifteen minutes to rock

Ten minutes to rock

Five minutes to rock
It only takes, Ooh

Until the day and my Goddess away
For you under planet and feed you a pomagranite
And the snakes, wish to rape
The lady will be faking love
From a firey pit

And when the night's moon
Lights up a bright room

I watch you rest with lunar eclipses
Come up from a Goddess Of Love
Come with me Goddess Of Love

Goddess Of Love
Goddess Of Love!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Just two good old boys
(Everyone now, come on)
Never meaning no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
(What were they doing man?)

Straightening the curves
Flattening the hills
Well, someday the mountain might get 'em
But the law never will

Making their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow

Just two good ol' boys
Wouldn't change if they could
They're fighting the system
Like two modern-day Robin Hoods

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Headache, you give me such a headache
And I don't know why
Headache, you can be such a headache
'Cause you're so uptight

Sometimes it's just so hard
To put up with you
I've come to rely on a pill or two
Cause you cause me such pain
Why does it act this way?
I'm so frustrated with everything
Won't you be nice?
Bring some ice for my head?

Headache, you give me such a headache
And I don't know why
Headache, you can be such a headache
'Cause you're so uptight

Sometimes it's just so hard
To sleep beside you
While we're in bed
I still lie awake

With a headache, you can be such a headache
And I don't know why
Headache, you can be such a headache, yeah

In my head
In my head
In my head...

And I don't know why

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

How can you go on this way?
A waste of every day
It's meaningless and sad
And I just have to say
That no one really wants to see you try
They like how you don't bitch about your slice of pie
I think you're a hundred times as good

Now what makes you want to stay?
I ask it everyday
It's not as if they had

Respect for what you say
'Cause they don't really want you to succeed
They're happy with the way you have a need for them
I think you should push them all away
Even if you stay and succeed
You will know that it's nonsense
And it doesn't wash off for a very long time

So don't be the one that didn't have the nerve
To stand up for yourself because you had to serve
Someone with some pretty dumb ideas

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Ain't that bad a place
I was born that way
I bite my fingernails
Still got bills to pay
You sure know what to say
I'll put you in your place
Land of the free, I'm on my way

I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA

Stop at coffee bean
This is like a dream
Let's run across the beach
Mama, what's the deal?
Nothin's wrong with me
Still waters running deep
Home of the brave, dog on a leash

I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA

And God save the king
God save the king
God save the king
Won't feel a thing
God save the king
God save the king
God save the king

I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA

Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA

Planes up in the sky
There's a missing man
A boy who didn't make it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You know I'd like to think
That you've been pretty cool
But I have given up lying to myself
You know it makes me laugh
To see you doing well
But it never fails to leave me so mystified
I'd like to know I don't think
That I will ever understand

Feeling pretty good about the big success
What makes people feel, the need to get their fill?


I guess it's not too hard to preach it to the choir
When you show them how to sing it and they sing along

I'd like to know I don't think that I will ever understand
It beats me down a little further every single day

I've made a natural selection of course it's none of the above

I'd like to know I don't think that I will ever understand
I want to feel like I don't have to try and understand

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I understand the need to feel love
But this time you've gone way too far
And now you believe that everyone's bad
And everyone's evil inside
I don't understand how you can think that way
'Cause there is a book and it says that this is all true

I understand the need to feel safe
But this time you've gone way too far


It's easy to see when you believe
That we're all so evil inside
There are so many that want you to think that way

'Cause there is a book and it says that this is all true
Yes there is a book and it says that this is all true
There is a book and it says that this is all true
Yes there is a book and it says that this is all true

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Any day now you'll call me up on the phone
Say you love me more than you ever did before

It's all that I can do right now
To make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of home

Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
That we're waging on each other forever more

It's all that I can do right now
To make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of home
Say you love me now

It's all that I can do right now
To make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of home
Say you love me now

Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war

Would you like some lemonade?
No, this ain't no minutemaid
Just today I picked them fresh
From the tree that I love best
Couldn't let them rot away
Like my father used to say

Oh, happy day
Lemonade

Long ago, I didn't know
Didn't care and couldn't grow
On my way in such a fuss
Passed the tree and catch the bus
Till the day I couldn't pass
Fallen lemons in my path
So with my mom, I now agree
And use the lemons life gives me

Oh, happy day
Lemonade

Hard times come to me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favourite
Don't you hate it
Baby, life's what you make it
Don't backdate it
Baby, Don't try to shade it
Beauty is naked

Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it
Anticipate it
Yesterday's faded
Nothing can change it
Life's what you make it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Listen, pretty mama
I want to be with you tonight, oh yeah
I know you left me
For someone younger than I, oh yeah

Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down

Listen, sweet baby, yeah
I know it's too late to 'xplain, oh yeah
Why I can't please you
I got you when I was sane, yeah

Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down

And the love you gave to me
Will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah

Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down

Will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah yeah

Bip bopping strangers
Downloading highs
Destroy the old god
Just pay the checks

Thank god breath of life
Has come to make us right, right, right

Use any method
Break any law
Ignore the feelings
Just make it raw

We justify our acts
When we provoke a laugh, laugh, laugh

Time is swallowing
All these little songs we sing

(Lead break)

We justify our acts
When we provoke a laugh, laugh, laugh

Time is swallowing
All these little songs we sing

Use any method
Break any law
Ignore the feelings
Just make it raw

Talk to our bodies
Say what you will
Without our numbers
Are we a pill?

Ooh, ooh-oh

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Never before have I fallen for someone who'd go on and do me like this
You were the one who would always follow through with the ease of building care
For a kiss

Say you love me
Say you love me

Get out the house 'cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up
And say
Betting on losers is always a good way to lose what you wanted to prove

Say you love me
Say you love me

You should be talking better
But still you tried to better me
And now you'll be making the truth

(Solo)

You should be talking better
But still you tried to better me
And now you'll be making the truth

Get out the house 'cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up

Everytime that I turn around
And just hear the same ol thing.
Trucks are tryin' to rock my back
To the place I couldn't keep.

I'm an a$$hole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground.
Take no prisoners, we're just visitors,
We don't care about anything.

Everytime that I turn around
And just hear the same ol crap.
Trucks are trying to grease the wheels
So they can get laid back.

I'm an a$$hole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground.
Take no prisoners, we're just visitors,
We don't care about anything.

That's the way the modern dukes rollin'.
It's every man here for himself.

Everybody
Love your body
'Cause it's here that you got to stay

Take you chances
Find romances
But you still got your bills to pay

When nothin's on my mind
She can't be far behind
Oh, beggin' me to stay
Or pushing me to crime

And I feel so helpless every time

Mr. Taxman can you hear me?
'Cause I know that you got one too
Down your jock strap
Don't you talk back
'Cause she's still got a hold of you

When nothin's on my mind
She can't be far behind
Oh, beggin' me to stay
Or pushing me to crime

And I feel so helpless every time
That's what you get for being blind

When nothin's on my mind

Jamie says since you called yesterday
I have felt so swell
Come back, come back from Mexico
I need your strength I need your help
Hated me won't you put me through
I miss you both, can't you tell
Please let that be you
Knocking on my door so loud just like you do
Bring in a letter or two

Hey midge, what you guys been up to
How's prince is he okay
Mrs. young I think you're the best

Ringing my phone right now let the wish you were too
Callin' with some good news

Stand by my side always be true

Raise my right hand I swear it's true

Singing my song so nice like you do
Humming along to your tune

Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear
Way down yonder in the old corn field

Say you love me
Meet me in the shade

My brain is working overtime
I need something to ease my mind
'Cause as my thoughts go manic
I really start to panic
There's no place to hind behind

I'm freaking and hallucinating
Going last when I should wait
My parents think I'm crazy
But damn I'm going crazy
I can't help my mental state

No
Ooh, la la (he's trippin')
Shank ti da (mental slippin')
Take these brains out of my way

I work into a frenzied fit
I bite the corners of my lip
I'm losing my appetite
My pants don't even fit right
Take away the the month old dip
Give me something for my hair
A fresher pair of underwear
'Cause if I was run over
By a brand new range rover
I just want it, I don't care

No
Ooh, la la (he's trippin')
Shank ti da (mental slippin')
Take these brains out of my way

I tell the world to fuck itself
It's you who decides what sick or health
And all the people I see
That's making lots of Benji's
Make me want to puke myself
Start a brand new fashion trend
Those are for the deeper end
Sedatives and No Doz
And edible pantyhose
They're on your plate so dig right in!

No
Ooh, la la (he's trippin')
Shank ti da (mental slippin')
Take these brains out of my way

I don't care

My summer girl
She was my world
He's got her now
Charmed her some how

I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I'll never be your type

All summer long
Feelings grew strong


All through the time
I was not blind

My summer girl

Everybody, don't make me laugh
'Cause it's not so insane
In the morning it comes to pass
And there's no one to blame

I'll tell you
My weakness

And if you knew the things I say
Then you'd have to believe
In the spirits above the sand
And the man in the tree

I'll tell you
My weakness

If you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Leave me to stay

I'll tell you
My weakness

If you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Leave me to stay

Is this it, are we done?
Must we carry on?
Like such fools shameless fools
Is it finally over?
Why when I call must you take so long?
Maybe weeks sometimes months
For you to call me back

You're so naive (you're so naive)
You're so naive (you're so naive)

My friends were right
Should have played it smooth
Should have tried to laugh


Instead of being true

I feel so numb inside
As I rest my head to go to sleep

One more time
Though I know it's wrong
Maybe you should do mine
And everything is fine

Feel so naive (feel so naive)
Feel so naive (feel so naive)

Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Another means I'll find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That I can never find a way to reach
My inner self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

There you are alone
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me.
Who do you think you are? What more do you want from me?!

Ball Tongue!
You got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me.
Ball Tongue!
The rag I'm on, we are justified.
Ball Tongue!
Congrats you just fucked-up my make-up and shit.
Ball Tongue!
What have they done for me?

Why are you at home buried in your own self pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me.
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?

Ball Tongue!
You have come to take from your buddy.
Ball Tongue!
You have never been so funky.

I've driven right by my friends.
Ball Tongue!
They've taken the take above me.
Ball Tongue!
And you're a psycho monkey.
Ball Tongue!
They've come to enslave me
Ball Tongue!
They've jacked themselves onto me.
Ball Tongue!
Your fuckin' gangster signs.
Ball Tongue!
They've come not to save them, but they take...

Fuckin' death to fuckin' me.

You're all psychopaths.
You're all psychopaths.

Ball Tongue!
Berome's dead at the technodrome.
Ball Tongue!
You're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped. But who was it?
Ball Tongue!
It doesn't of the rhythm of the damn monger.
Ball Tongue!
Never die! Never die!
Ball Tongue!
And then, the man kept kickin' me.
Ball Tongue!
He gets him on, they're cool.
Ball Tongue!
He wasn't dead and then they knocked him on the head.
Ball Tongue!
No more, he's rid of you
And you're a dyke

I 
I am confused 
Fighting myself
Wanting to give in 
Needing your help
Skin cold with fear 
Feel it when we touch
Outside I don't know you
But inside I'm fine

Can you see it in me? 
Skin cold from touch
Each day confronted with what I have done
You pull me closer
I push you away
You tell me it's okay
I can't help but feel the pain

I hate you
Why are you taken?
I love you
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I lay with you
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?

Scream at me again, if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might

Scared to be honest, be yourself, a cowardly man

Take away the only love inside you

You think I'm out to scare you

And you're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine

Tell me why you never liked me
Tell me once that you'll fight me
Pull down and wait for the perfect time
To take what's rightfully mine
You think they're dumb to defy me
You said you don't, but defy me
You wait, you don't want anyone
Oh well

You're gonna waste your time
Your life will soon be mine

Go

I can in every way 
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes at me 
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?
It runs away 
It's so predictable

I can in every way 
Feel the stress that tangles up inside
Too blind to see
Emptiness and the sorrow of their lives
You run away 
To the cover of their pointless ties
You ask me
It's so predictable

I'm gonna try
I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try

Another day
Silence overwhelms my mind
Who's to say if I have the time or why?
Should I pray for all the hate to go away?
Another day
I can never break free

You wait for me
I crawl up to you
Another day
I'll live forever

Why should I?

I'm gonna try
I'm gonna die

Oh

False emotions tears you fronted

While you're so in pain

Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

Do you ever
See it out from inside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

I would like to
Search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to
Open your body and let me touch you?

Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

Do you ever
See it out from inside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your fears

I want you to see
The life you have disguised.
The world of things that hurt you 
Kept all these useless lies.
I want you to fear
Fill you on up inside 
Once I took you in
I'll throw you out next time 

I tried
You win
My life
Is rippin' your heart out and destroyin' my pain!
Go!

Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

Do you ever
See it out from inside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

Do you ever
See it outside your fears?
Thinkin' about your life
Thinkin' about your inner fears

Hello?
Esta Caco? 
Et eres Caco? 
Pues, you know, you fuckin' call me the Caco, okay? 

I keep asking, "What's your lie?"
It is disturbing, this isn't mine

Days keep passing, one notch at a time
I don't feel right
Please, God, let me sleep tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why

Want to give it up, but I can't escape 
Want to give it up, but I can't escape
Want to give it up, but I can't escape
Want to give it up, but I can't escape

I keep asking, "Can we please try?"
It is haunting, this takes my mind

Days keep passing, line after line
I don't feel right
Please, God, don't let me die tonight
Die tonight, die tonight, die tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why

Want to give it up, but I can't escape
Want to give it up, but I can't escape
Want to give it up, but I can't escape
Want to give it up, but I can't escape

Please, God
Please, God

Please, God, help me
Please, God, free me
Please, God, help me from my painful situation

Please, God, help me
Please, God, free me
Please, God, save me from my painful situation

Please, God, help me
(Want to give it up, but I can't escape)
Please, God, free me 
(Want to give it up, but I can't escape)
Please, God, save me from my painful situation 
(Want to give it up, but I can't escape)

Please, God, don't let me sleep in tonight, please, God
Oh, please, God, don't let me give in tonight, please, God
Oh, please, God, don't let me sleep in tonight, don't let me die
Please, God, don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die

Mother, please forgive me, I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, lookin' so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, lookin' so sweet
A rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down 
"That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?

Little child, lookin' so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy

You've raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down!
"That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why?

It's all right

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down 
"That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child 
I rape, no one hears me
It hurt as a child, tied down, you would hit me
And rip your own child
I'm sick, no one hears me
It hurt as a child, tied down 
"That's a good boy"
And fought your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt as a child, tied down
No one hears me
Mommy, why your own child?

"I didn't touch you there"
Mommy said she didn't care
"I didn't touch you there"
That's why mommy stopped and stared

Little child, lookin' so sweet
A rape in my eyes, and on your flesh I'll eat

You raped, I feel dirty!
It hurt as a child, tied down!
"That's a good boy"
And fuck your own child
I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?


You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt as a child, tied down!

You son of a bitch, you fuckin' ruined my life
You fucked, I'm sick of it
You fuckin' bitch, I hate you

Pain!

Buried so far away. 
Into my life of nothing.

Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!

I am so high always. 
Burying my life so slowly.

Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!

It opens my mind to feelings. 
Can't face boredom without something.

Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!

Re-entering my head, 
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me.

Can't you feel this pain?
Reaming through my heart!
Screaming through my veins!
Nothing I can kill!
Screaming a
Lie 
I
Am
Can't you tear 
My 
Eyes 
Out?
Can't you take my heart?
Away
To heart

Good-bye

Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing
So I dig a hole, bury pain!

Pain.

Why can't I decide?
Why my feelings I hide?
Always screwing with my mind, 
That thorn in my spine.
Oh sure, it feels fine, 
Wasting all our time.
In the back of my mind, 
That thorn in my spine.

Wait! 
See it before my eyes.
Why? 
Do I turn away?

Looking all the time, 
At your face so blind.
Feeling uptight, 
Always the same fight.
Hey man now decide, 
Go ahead take your time.
Kissing all the time, 
That thorn in my spine.

Wait! 
You cannot see inside.
Why! 
Play yourself out that way.
Why! 
You and me always hate.
Wait! 
Weren't you my friend?

The pain and rage and fear I feel!
The pain and rage and fear I feel!

Hey man look inside, 
Now you need your own life.
Remember me guy? 
That thorn in your spine.
Waiting all the time, 
I'm doing mighty fine.
Remember me guy? 
The thorn in your spine.

Wait! 
You cannot see inside.
Why? 
Play yourself out that way.
Why? 
You and me always hate.

Wait! You were my friend.

You came into my life 
Without a single thing
I gave in to your ways, 
Which left me with nothing
I've given in to smiles, 
I fell for all your games
I wish so bad right now, 
I hadn't let you in

Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!

The sea of life, 
You're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my brain

I scream without a sound.
How could you take away
Everything that I was? 
Made me a fuckin' slave.
Your face that I despise.
Your heart inside that's grey.
I came today to say
You're fucked in every way

Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!
Won't you get the fuck out of my face
Now?!

The sea of life, 
You're just a minnow
Live your life insecure
Feel the pain of your needles
As they shit into my mind
You stole my life
Without a sigh
You suck me dry

Why do you make me?

I have no place to hide, which I like.

Some will look at the time I looked back into my life.
You wanna touch me to see what's in my eyes.
Why do you make me? 
Remember my hate, all this shame?
Don't you hate me sometimes?

I have no place to run or hide.

And you know that I'm from the wicked crew,
You act like you knew
But I got everybody jumpin' to the voodoo
You kickin' wicked rhymes, picket signs, me and my mob got a truck load of 9's.
Drop then I'll slay ya, bang, bang, birthday for the A-hole
Ready to buck, buck, buck,
But it's a must to duck, duck, duck
Before I bust ya!
Lookin' for the one that did it
You want my vote?
No you're never gonna get it!
'Cause I'm the one with the tight mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills,

All you see is big black boots,
Step in, use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quiet, you want to live with this nigga to with a stick
Uh, but that's nasty, 'cause I got a Body Count like Ice-T
From here to New York I get them skins, and I ain't talkin' about pork
Your sly, you pig, dig
Listen from the flow from a soul fro'ed caucasian
Your picket signs, you know all
This funky ass wisdom picket
But your talkin'.
