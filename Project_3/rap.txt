Rasta dem king of da jungle
Dreadlocks swing down me back like Repunzel
My bread run sling dem pack in a bundle
We'll take yo ting sell it back to yo uncle
And we'll make it rain till ya dances to come true
We'll make it rain till ya better bring a swim suit
Alone when I came but I'm leavin' wit dem too
Girls give me brain give me brain like Temple
And him got game game sharp like a pencil
Now if you want vermeils we can crash like a cymbal
Look upon me window I'm a new sports coupe
12 horses in da hood sittin' on horseshoes
Come from da land dat Jesus walk through
Sacrifice me life man I bleed for me own crew
Dem no wanna rum rum wit me dem no want to
Murder dem and da family dem belong to

Gangsta dem know it run da street like da car do
You can either leave me or dearly depart you
Hip hop is mines now mines what ya gone do
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two
Play time for me 'cause see to me they are cartoons
How come every joint be on point like a harpoon
How come every bar stand strong like a bar stool
How come every line so raw you gone snort to
Murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem
Man I murder dem man I murder dem
Fuck a competition man I murder dem

Wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, wha wha, what

Straight off the black gold, nuts in my hand, trustin' no man
Got my glock cocked, runnin' this thing, ya understand

Niggas bustin' heads and, runnin' duckin' Feds and
Rocks under they tongues and, ki's under they beds and
Hood fulla real niggas, twenty-four seven hustlers
Eh, until we shove a barrel down your pipe suckers
Ain't no love for no busta, no fear for no coward
No respect from no stunt, and no money without power
We keepin' niggas hotter, ewww nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and BLAKA at every hour
Some niggas like that powder, foldin' up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins (oh)
From the home of that 'caine, jackin' and crackin' brains
Broadcastin' live from tha Block it's Lil Wayne (who it is?)

Juve: Nigga you got that yayo?
B.G.: Well cook something nigga
Juve: Nigga you let them K's go?
B.G.: Well bust somethin' nigga

Dodgin' cops and burnin' blocks, so we be thugged out
It's time to floss, bring the big bodies on dubs out
And they got quarters, halfs, and birds in that one house (I got it)
(I got it) It's all good in the hood but a lot illegal
Soon as you get it, hot skirt, there go them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggas murder off top, boy
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys

We don't know what be goin' 'cause we so blunted from trees
And we'll be 'round you all day till we "400 Degreez"
And you see where niggas go, nobody be on the pulpit
They got a nigga got on a scarf, he flippin' out off that raw
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure (beep beep) your door is locked
Cause this ain't nothing proper, cause Tha Block, is just Hot

Juve: Nigga you got that yayo?

Juve: Nigga you let them K's go?

See watch your step on my set, gotta walk like, talk like
We done shot out all the street lights
So you can't see who we be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, 'cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggas been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin' wit
Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hah, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggas that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin' weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Go all out for that cake, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie 'em up put 'em in the vans, then put a gat in his jaws
... Tch, one move blow his cactuses off

Juve: Nigga you got that yayo?
B.G.: Well cook something nigga
Juve: Nigga you let them K's go?
B.G.: Well bust somethin' nigga
Juve: Are you duckin' that law?

Mannie (of Big Tymers):
I put 'Cris stains on private planes, 'cause it's my jet,
Nigga, money ain't shit cause my rottweilers drink 'Moet.
Diamond baugette bracelets... for my lovers...
Playa, I use 'Cristal to lubricate rubbers...
Who got, shit on his wrist that cost three nickel?
Who got, the project on lock when that nigga slangin' pickle?
Who got a, benz, a prowler--playboy--and a 'Vette...
Tell the truth, who fucked ya' on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mama's from N.O. to New York?
Who got, every bitch attention in this muthafucka' when he talk?
Now who the fuck we talkin' bout, look--Y'all don't know?
I'll give you a hint... See that bitch you with? He fucked that ho.
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch? It's like Harlem World video,
White diamonds, red rubies, blue baugettes, I don't know...
Shorty, whens the next time I'm'a be up in your bed,
I love you? You love me? Well go head on, and give me some head...

Juvenile: (Chorus 2x)
Loud pipes, Big rims,
Whodi, that's our life...
When we pull up at the club,
Sorry, that's our night...
I know a lot of haters out there,
Sayin', that that's not right...
But our diamonds are much bigger,
So, that's our life...

Baby (of Big Tymers): No doubt, Juve'! Lah-lah...
I told Sol, "I need somethin' with some hell of a ice," (Ice...)
Nigga came back with a hell of a price... (Price...)
That ain't nothin', these ho's doin' hell'a wrong... (Violatin')
Callin' these niggas on our cell phone, (Violatin')
Bitch ridin' Benz on twenty-inch chrome, (Chrome..)
Gimme the key, the car ho, and the alarm... (All my shit..)
For my Prowler, my Jag, my Benz and my home, (Give it here...)
Bitch, you'll never ride twenty-inch chrome... (Neva' Neva' Neva')
I love to shine, that's why the choppa's mine, (Mine...)
Hit my block in my Benz, ho, with stretch tires, (Tires...)
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive, (Drive...)
Brought it to 'Tunes before a nigga could sign, (Sign right here...)
Now put the Bose system right behind my eyes, (Eyes...)
With the VC's and TV's, so a nigga could shine... (Shine...)
Let my ice **Bling Bling** like a nine to five, (Five...)
And tell all my ho's, they don't need no job (No job, whodi...)

Juvenile: (Chorus 2x)

BG: I ride the best...
From a Benz, to a Jag, to a Beamer, to a Lex,
Might fly first class on Delta, helicopter, or a jet,
I'm a stunna, I'm a reppa, G'zy like to shine,
Drink Don, Moet, and Crissy, that's the finest wine,
Twenty inches is the only thing I'll sit my shit on,
Don't bring ya' bitch around me, cause my dick she'll wanna sit on,
And I ain't gon' tell her nothin' different, that's ya issha, (Issue..)
But after she come back, your best out is not to kiss her,
Ho's sick, sayin' damn, look at Fresh pinky ring,
Look at BG watch, that bitch bling-aling-aling...
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never,
See me sportin' nothin' that ain't 20 G's or betta,
Me and Wayne take the left, Juvy and Baby take the right,
It's dark in the room, we hold up our watches and it's light,
Cash Money Millionaires livin' a hell of a life,
Like my nigga Weezy said, "Surrounded by iceee..."

Juvenile: (Chorus 2x)

Lil Wayne: Whoa... Whoa... Whoa...
Now, I'm shinin, beamin, glossin, Big Tymin, stuntin, and flossin...
Lamborghini sit on broaders, with two more in my garages...
Plus, a blue and black Ferrari, with Nintendo and Atari,
Man, I swear the car is awesome... Vroom! Sorry, we lost 'em...
I'm back, I pull up smellin' like dimesacks and 'Conyac...
I leave in a Hummer, hour lata' I'm flyin' back,
Sshhhhh... private jet's about to land,
The women fall out when I let 'em touch my hand,
I get out the plane into a Mercedes-Benz van,
TV's all over with chrome twenty-inch fans,
Damn... God - damn... Man - I am... L-I-L... Weezy, off the heezy...
But still and all, ice floodin' out my watch,
And in my grill and all, Porche Box', run blocks,
SKRRT! Peelin' off, Me and Slim in a Rover,
Beatrice... Brick holder, Cash Money young soldier... Whoa!

Juvenile: (Chorus 3x)

Juvenile:
Mmmmmmmmmmmm... Wheezy-Wee...
Cash Money Millionaires in this muthafucka,
Respect it, or check it!

(Lil Wayne)
Got a early call from Kisha
Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then l'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
'Cause she wanted me to see her
Said l needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater
Left Ne-Ne with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber 'cause I heard she was a freak
They say she ???
But I don't want HIV
?????
Her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said ooh Kisha
This what I got to meet her
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro
Oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep
I got some more meat to feed ya

(Turk)
Now I'm hot
I wonder was up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call
See if it's all right
For me to dip through
She said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good
I'll be there in a minute
She didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin' out
He saw me dippin in but he didn't know ???
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin' to myself look at this dog ass hoe
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Call my nut now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got through lil tonight me and the H-Beezey
I can't be late
I'm gone see ya when I could
Here's Juve on the hip
Let 'em know it was all good

(Juvenile)
Ooh Ooh there she go
On the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know
We done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed
She told me for Danny
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
'Cause she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and now I said fuck it
Say boo I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good and you have it not to telly

(B.G.)
Bitch hold on do I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin' out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no walls
But she told me she'd do a damn job on them boys
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin' and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head
End up doing somethin' bad ha
Kisha got did right yeah
Fucked the whole Cash Money click all in one night yeah

Already was straight now we livin' larger
Already was ballin' now we ballin' harder

Bouncin' through diamonds high beamin'

A fifteen year old shot caller baby
And I'm racin' through

Got yo' wife at my house
And she naked too
And all my niggas all around
Sayin' 'Shake it Boo, go ahead to what you do'
It's Weezy dog and off the heezy dog
And I'm surrounded by the ice
It got me freezin' dog
And it's plain and simple
Won't change 'cause it's natural
Lil Wayne a pimp y'all
Got the game from Beatris
I'm trying to see six numbers
Pull up at the Grammy awards in six Hummers
Leave the Grammy awards with six womens
And make a stop at the gas station for six rubbers
Put it together
This is the life when you get full of the cheddar
Don't try to end it or you wouldn't get better, what

(Wayne)
La, la, la, la
Here I come star rapper
I get the fast money
Short, cute hot boy that rapper Cash Money
Standin' out the roof of my car
And flash hundreds
Take your girl to the mall
Spend a G like that's nothin'
She lay on the floor
Open up the spot
Take off her draws
Let me see the cunt
Don't stop Lil' Weezy
We's ain't nothin' nice
But gats in my Jesus Christ
Nothing but ice
When they see me at night
Behind ?? I stay high
Snatch yo' wife
Run up in her with the K-Y
But it's on man
Ever since I was born Wayne
Nigga get out of line
I get dirty like John Wayne
I'm bout stuntin', flossin'
Whatever come with it
And I don't shoot guns
Unless they have a drum wit it
At first they wasn't wit it
Thought that I was jokin'
Now I got 'em all payin' attention like they owe it

You know what time it is (What)
You know what time it is (What)
Strap -Up (Gun Cocks)

A lot of niggas better move out
Cause here I come with my click
With the tools out
All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin' to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to lose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brain
No matter the weather
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
I'ma slang that metal
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood
To get it together
'Cause I'm the tolas mario
And we down for whatever
Never underestimate or you goin' under
Y'all keep on playin' with Lil Wayne
But that lil' boy trouble
And plus this shorty be full, wodie
Be scorin' bundles, them start wildin' and
Hit the block and let his toys rumble
And it go ratter tatter
Ya be surprised how niggas scatter
When the M-1 shatter
And everybody on they block
They get bout ten in they bladder

Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent
Your life's gone
We done left the block quiet

La
When it's time to ride
It ain't no time to play
It could be time to die
At any time of the day
And I'll be goddammit
If I let a nigga steel me
It will not happen
I'ma fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em
And got my glocks rammin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us
I chief three blunts
So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush
I'm sick and tired
Niggas choosin' test a boy
They get hit and die
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partner get lit up
And then they ask why
That's cause you played wit' me
They couldn't of known I'm'a guerilla
Drama stayed with me
Run in his home went to kill him
Took his head with me
You better get it right or keep it right
Or lose your whole town
Tell em' lights off
It's about to go down

Massacre all these streets block it off
Lil Wayne in yo' hood
With something like a rocket dog
And I'm after ya
I don't pass beef

That boy got a head on his shoulders
I knock it off
I'm highly intoxicated mixing krystelle and vodka
Somebody call the doctor
Cause my chopper done went blocka, knocka
Nigga out the way man
I'm sorry but us guerillas we can't stay tamed, say it man
Are you ready, ready
Ready for warfare Wayne, Turk, Juvi, and BGeezy they all there

Bullets they come steadily
You better stay off the block

You better stay off the block
Cause the lights off

Look, look, look

A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin' rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
'Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin' liquor like it's water, gettin' pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin' to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
Duckin the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin'
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin' that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this

Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin' talkin' 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin' to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck

Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin' that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' bills

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Say, Weezy
(Weezy)
Can they remember me?
Lil' Weezy

Make 'em remember, ya, nigga
(Ha)
Let these niggas know your background, nigga
(Look, look)
Let 'em know your background
(Look, look)
Let 'em know how you've been for a while

All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess and bust it in they chest

I had ta hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Had ta struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts
Stick bricks under they dress

Them niggas there with me fooli'
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'

Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds

Shorty, wow, hair all over my head
Bandana 'round my brain, eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench
When niggaz playin', they get drenched

My pockets is full of lead
So, nigga, stay off the Benz, I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed
So I'on't even hesitate to leave 'em on tha curb
And wet dem niggaz shirt, nigga, get 'em full of birds
Tell them niggaz, Geezy

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die

Lil' Weezy Wee had ta steal, hustle and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

Look, look, that time I forgot tha bills
Ain't been home in two weeks
Macita lookin' for me
Tha word all over tha streets

Well, shit, I love my momma
But all I got ta offer is drama
And many problems, I lay back in tha cut

These niggas out and I rob 'em
They ain't spin around here
We all alone on my block
Like nobody live 'round here

Tha lights got cut off at my house
And now I'm lookin' for a window
I can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on tha floor
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz

Hey man, them boys ain't riders
Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired
(Break it off)
Well, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address
He said he got that work
And needed me ta meet I'm there
(Meet him there)

Nigga, take your Roly down
With somethin' shady, daddy
(What?)
Within a week he changed his mind
And received tha package
(What?)

Oh well, back to tha drawin' board
(Board)
Cowards start hollerin'
'Cause they know I'm comin' for it

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die

Lil' Weezy Wee had ta steal, hustle and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

Lemme tell 'em, you remember
That there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out
Blunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought
Run in your house, "Lay down, nobody move
Tell that slut go get your stash and empty your pockets, fool"

That's how it was crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs make niggas come ta answer them up
Some niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me
My lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me

Okay
(Okay)
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta relocate
(Locate)
'Cause, see, y'all got it
I gotta make my cheese rotate
(Rotate)

Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have
My stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin' week for week

No, sleep livin', look outside ya window
In tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin', I'm ready ta sweep these niggas
Geezy make 'em remember Weezy, nigga

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die

Lil' Weezy Wee had ta steal, hustle and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die

Lil' Weezy Wee had ta steal, hustle and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

Look, remember that?
Wuz up
(Are you rememberin', B.Geezy?)

Listen, listen

Raw and nasty
Tha AK, I pack it
Believe I'm 'bout that action
Slash a busta like a fraction
I'm on that yolla
Standin' on tha corner with one sleeve over my shoulder
Ride on your block, I see a dozen of weak jerks
Now it's time for your momma ta order a dozen of T-shirts
For only half-a brick
I'll blast tha fifty
And I ain't gon' stop shootin' till I jam tha clip
Yeah, I'm a small creeper, what
But it's about ta get ugly
Y'all betta call people up
I'm about ta start shovin' my sawed-off between your guts
Wayne 'bout ta (cugghh-gghh-gghh) ball people up
Y'all betta duck
When it get real, they hide from me
But, all them bustas 'bout ta get killed, I'm tired of it
Man, I'm thuggin' till tha day I... I die, cousin
Weezy Wee... let 'em burn, bring tha fire truck in... (whoooo!)

Nigga, let it be known
I'll come blow up your home
Take a few blunts to tha dome
And... show up alone
Just me and my... flame-torch
Wayne start... danger
Walked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya
Burnin' off that Hennesy
Some-a y'all be feminine
Bounce in with a twitch
Leave 'em crawlin' out a ditch
God damn... son of a shhh!.. Don't speak
I cocked that, and let it go, tssss!.. Give 'em heat
Your cheese, I got... ta... get... paid
I'm goin' all out, no matter what... it... takes
I... was... raised... up on... that... paper
Kill-for-the-scrill was... in... my... nature
Tote M1's and keep... tha... block... hot
Sell wrong colts to keep... my... glock... hot
Never add taxes to... my... price, man
And if a boy play, I ride... at... night, man

Respect the game
'Cause I got the game

(Lil Wayne)
Y'all know who I is
Weezy coming through in the bubble eye Benz
See me front in back with the wood all around
Plus I got that surround sound
Don't hate on me boy if you do get down
Come from under my shirt try to lift you off the ground
But on the other hand, I'ma keep running man
I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man
We stuntas man
I might stumble across a grand and give it to you wifey
And watch how she *slurp* on my pipey like a Icee
I might be in a Range that night
I might be in a Lex watching the game tonight
I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right
But if I lose, its cool, that's some change lil shite
That ain't nothing
I ain't doing nothing if I, I ain't stunting
Hold up, girl be quiet, Lil Wayne coming.

(Baby)
Slow yo roll lil one
You ain't glad its bought
And Ms. Pat and gray head over there
In the back card gambling
At the bar dranking
But go head, just be quiet with 'em lil one

(Lil Wayne)
Broads I use 'em
Hatas I bluse 'em
My whole front grill is full of confusion
Got dammit
Weezy pull up in a Porsche, expanded (expanded)
I was to the back, niggas couldn't stand it
Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished
I got it like that
Got Rolex, blue shit hard to say watches
Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches
Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches
Million dolla man baby tear da beasy
Catch me sippin on some Hen, maybe Covoursier
Sammy, Mario, tody Taz, that's my posse
And what
You might see me dippin low in a Benz truck
Tell yo girl hello
I done did her, what you muggin me for
Keep playin' with me, I'll put a slug in yo do

(Mannie)
Now looky here, young blood
Pull yo pants up on yo ass and put that piece of metal up in yo shirt
Don't make me get up out this wheel chair and kick yo ass
Now keep doing what you doing
Go head

Y'all know me, young playa, stomp with the big dogs
Play with me boy I give you cancer like menthol
Cough cough cough up
Got a cat eye benz on brollas

Get in they head, they be like, Quit Wayne!
Half hour later, I'm in they split man

Let me get real

Steal for the scrill
I will never leave my clique nigga, I'm to trill

But I'm a ape in that jungle
And if you get it twisted,

Leave her taste in my rubber
I'm a playa nigga, I'm a playa

When I'm flissin a bitch
Niggas shoulders gettin' knocked
Clean off of they head
See that red dot comin' from
Me and my girlfriend
'Cause I wants mine
I needs mine
And I'm about to get mine
At these times
Look lil' daddy
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin' to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all
Even though a nigga rich and I rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright

(Chorus 2x (Juvenile and Lil Wayne))

It's enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go

Four hit the blocks
Strapped up with the Uzis

What, What, La

Bless me when I'm gone
But until then load up the chrome 'cause it's on

I drop the top and then I flip I hit his cock and make 'em flip
And I be full of that trash
I be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast
Watch the bullets chop off the head
And make 'em fall in the grass
One move they all die
Lil' Weezy small frie
Guerilla when it's war time
Y'all better learn
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
????????????????
Seven churn and I be damn if I let 'em go
If I don't get my dough
Then hell will be all blowin'
Till I R.I.P CMR I be
I put it down for all my peeps
Nigga, I'm HB for real

All I know is the streets
And how to strap up
When it's time shoot it
Cock yo' heaters
Tie up yo' bags
It's time to do it
Blaze the blunt
Shut off the lights
And cut down the music
Roll down the windows
Turn the corner
And let loose with the bbbbrrrrrr
If ya don't know now
Then ya never will learn
You ca play with Lil Wayne
And yo' block get burned
You must love to go swimmin
Cause tha water gets deeper
See I bust you wide open
And take 'ya daughter with me
Here come the beat boy
Shoot out the street lights
Time to bring on the heat boy
If you ain't really wit it
Then you better get back
I open yo' chest
And make it look just like a wet cat
This is a death trap
I'ma a guerilla and I mean it
Leave ya' head still in a beanin'

Red dot beamin'
Dressed up suspicious
Play with lil' Weezy you'll be ?? for the vicious

So get caught up in that place and your brain get spilled
Oh it's a game but it's a game of life or death
You lose and can't continue if you get dome checked
You get blues it's all what duck gonna be next
Come in that water and get wet

A uptown stunter, what the hell you think
Ready for war, BUT I AIN"T NO CAPTAIN OF NO GOT DAMN TANK!
And you can take that to vegillity boy
I'm burning up, I'm on fire is you smelling boy
'Cause I be coming with the top down
Letting them know how the chop sound
100 rounds tore the whole entire block down
Assault rifle with a drum and beam totter
38 with a speed loader in my holster
Mac ozze achine with a strap around my shoulder
But if I pop my trunk I'm might just set off a damn explosure
I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
Got a sawd oil tec and I'm bout to knock off your brain
Tell 'em

You ain't gotta hollar wodie, here I come nigga! (x2)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Look, where I go from here?
Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rather come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm comin' man
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be runnin' man
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son ridin' everyday on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And see ???, Mrs. Roe, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra
Dawg, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool livin' off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me

It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, 'cause everythang gon' be all right
I know it's hard tryna make but it's gon' be all right

All right I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dawg, thangs got wild
I know you probably sayin' 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin' millions now
So I still smile
I'm takin' care ya wife brah
Ain't nothin' changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who payin' the bills now, ah hah
Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah
I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thuggin' nigga, playa you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, all a the Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me

I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me every time watchin the boys shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul every time I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin' all the love to me
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me

I mean it's up to me man
Just watch over me
And it's gon' be all gravy man
Leavin' big, treatin me all good
Everythang else be all good
Rest in peace ya heard me
I'll be there

(Lil Wayne)
Aw aw
Aw aw!
Aw aw!
Peep me out, look!
Head bustin', black fatigues
So blunted, 400 degreez, it's sweet
Nigga, respect me
When you see tha left hand buggin', nigga, respect it
But if you see tha left hand bustin', nigga, your disrespectin'
Took one to tha chest, I never die, I'm tha same brotha
Jump out and shoot K's, let 'em fly, I'm tha same brotha
It's a must they recognize that I'm untamed, brotha
Disconnect a boy like a damn change number
Uh, hang up and try again
I kill ya, wake ya up, and make you die again
Spark it up, and make a nigga block fry again
Go ta jail, and do life, not five ta ten
Me, Lil' Mario, and Toolie, that's my man, fam
My niggas don't give a Jean-Claude VanDamme
About'chu, 'cause we don't play around
Bring tha K around, spray tha town, take tha ground
Take tha ground that you walk on
Tap tha phones that you talk on
Jam ya up and take your arms off
I hit you twice with tha sawed-off
And your nigga just watch your head fall off... fall off
You think ya love me, I shoot anybody that look suspicious (what)
I bust tha three-six until tha damn drum bust (what)
I hit tha hood, (I hit tha hood) be up in all black, (be in all black)
Numb-nut
I run up in your house with a tommy gun, what
I'm standin' there like all mine
Run through your click like a weak defensive line
Doggy fresh

(Turk)
You want war, nigga, let's beef... beef
We can do it how ya want, or take it to tha streets... streets
I'll be dressed in camouflage, Ree's on my feet
Through your air (through your air) leave ya burnin' like heat
What ya... know, I'm tha one from tha T.C.
Chopper shooter, block bruiser, I'll bet any G (any G)
On fire, nigga, label, that's a HB
And if I can't kill you... killin' your family (family)
Think it's a game, 'rilla, test my nuts, you'll see
How fast I send shots through your 6V (6V)
Heads bust if ya really think it's CMB
And I know you all know about Slim and B
We get our ball on, nigga, drink Cristy
Me and Buck get head from meekos in Tennessee
Betta ask somebody, nigga, I been a G
And the Baby still servin' niggas for ten a key... nigga

(Lil Wayne)
Aw, aw, aw, look
Call me big baller, Big Tymer, big pockets
Call me big stunter, big stick, or big body
Call me that lil' nigga with tha Role... fulla diamonds
Call me tha number one Hot Boy on fire
Fire, when you shoot outta town, then I'ma holler
With a crate of Crystile, couple of blunts, and a condom
Let him know if (let him know if) he down bad, that ain't my problem
Ler him know if he come at me bad, then I'ma chop him
Ch-uh... chop him
Put tha flame to him
All of a sudden tha thing hits straight through him
'Cause I'm tha same nigga, pimper boy, Lil Wayne
Thugged out, pants fall to my shoe strings
But since I use ta be... doin' tha best at thangs
That mean I gotta wear a vest that day
I really think them niggas jealous... of tha sparkle in my necklace
He ain't ready... he ain't ready

It was the summer of 2001
And I saw the whole fuckin' thing
Yo! Can I say fuck on TV?
These guys had on some squad, shit!
It was Lil Wayne, two puppies, one child, and a dike
But not just any dike, Dick Van Dike
Hey, can I give a few shoutouts to my people?
Yo mom! Yo dad! What's up? Cool! I'm on TV!
Hey, I been tellin' them guys to get off the corner!
(I mean y'all know I'm good for...)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like ??? come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin' to get this dope continuos
Ball till I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin' to fall
Want everybody numb like ambasol
But he heard

Uh oh
There go them fuckin' po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner

I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
Hem gangstas doin' time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin'
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist because lil man is trippin'
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin' gravy, but save it
'Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin' sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tecks
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fetti
Be on the block until them souljas hit it
That's when he heard...

Blocka
Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner

All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin' in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin' for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin' qp's to ki's
Gangin' in the cheese, them bricks is comin'
No droughts I don't sit on nothin'
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay 'em a visit
That's when ya heard...

Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner

(Chorus 1,2,3,3 repeat 2x)

Uh oh, you better get off the corner, skirt
Blocka, you better get off the corner
Come here, you better get off the corner
Get off the corner, Get off the corner
What, uh oh, get off the corner
What, uh oh, you better off the corner
What, uh oh, you better off the corner
What, uh oh, you better off the corner
Like dat, Get off the corner

(Lil Wayne)
Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
Or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
And z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people,
When I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind

(Hook (Lil Wayne))
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

(Lil Wayne)
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner till the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
'Cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than "The Three Lil Pigs'" last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind

(Hook (Lil Wayne))
Tell 'em, "Whaaat!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

I tell 'em, "Whaaat!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

(Lil Wayne)
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks till I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time

(Hook-4x (Lil Wayne))
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind

(Lil Wayne)
Look,
Whaaaaaa

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks
Niggas that's 'bout beefin' - lettin' them K's spark
Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

(Hook (B.G.))
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)

(Juvenile)
I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'ma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, "Juvenile, stay off them streets."
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', "Fuck the police!"
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

(Hook-4x (B.G.))
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)

(B.G.)
I run the streets 'cause I'm real if it's daylight or dark
You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me
I've been in the game - niggas know what I'm 'bout
So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga

(Hook (B.G.))
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
We done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
Nigga, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)
Now, we done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
'Cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

(Hook (B.G.))
We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)

We hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
And we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)

We done hit you up, lit you up, twist you up (Ooh!)
Now, we done chopped you up, popped you up, boxed you up (Ooh!)

I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father
Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions

What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin'
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin' herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin'
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise

I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin', burn deep
But it's all right dog, everything gon' be all right dog

I know you see my daughter growin' up and bad as ever
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin' from nothin'
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some "squash it" and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin' at the way I treat these hoes and these
Bitches
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin'
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me

I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin' above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said "thay's my peoples"
Watch over me nigga till I see you

(Wayne talking)
I know I can't be close to you (dog)
I know you watching over me dog
But the shit's that it hurt and burn deep
Its all right dog, everything gon' be all right dog
Rabid, nigga, it's your son
I'm down in your hole and your down
You see Cita strait, mom strait
Your mom strait, I mean Everything going right
Me and Slim nigga, is the realist niggas I ever met dog
And plus now I'm on some Squad Shit
My niggas, they keep it real with me
I keep it real with them
My little girl growning beutiful as ever man
You need to see her dog, she bad though man
Anyway dog, aiight holla!

They can't fuck with me now
Huh? Fuck with me now
No, they can't fuck with me now
Can't fuck with me now
Let's go

(VERSE 1 - Lil Wayne)
I go by "Wheezy: the Don"
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, and freezin' the arm
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck (?)
(?) We so sip
It's like ain't nothin' but we gotta squab
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs
Ain't nothin' sweet 'cause I can't keep trust
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga
Pullin' out the K's, nigga - (??) and all
Wayne 'bout to damage your home
Nigga 'bout to go to see the man in the stars
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all
Cannons went off
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your avenue's gone
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame
That's because she ran into the game
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne
Come on!

(Hook) (Lil Wayne)
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
No! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya

(VERSE 2 - Lil Wayne)
Iceberg Shorty - (??) pants is saggin', forty magnum
Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'
Ten in the Ferrari wagon, braggin'
Oh, what's happenin'?
(??) 'Round the court 'cause some ex just looked at me
Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the av with the crack and a 'matic
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it
First of the month, just snatched me a package
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him
Shit get drastic
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to ease on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Wheezy Whee - CMB's in my blood
In the streets seventeen's where I'm from
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens
Really, though, fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I don't give a damn if you hate me
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D
Until the bigger man do take me
Squad shit!
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet
Or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence
Come on! What!

(Hook) (Lil Wayne)
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now, them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Uh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Come on!

(VERSE 3 - Lil Wayne)
It's too dark for ya's
I ain't got no love for ya's
Let gunshots smoked ya's
Who fuck with us?
Weed, liquor done corrupted us
Wet a nigga like umbrellas
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it
Niggas be kiddin' - me awake, deal away
Gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face
Oh, shit - niggas on that whole shit
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:
I cause fatalities for any technicality
Wipe off your family randomly - ya understand?
It ain't no motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'
Come on!

(Hook) (Lil Wayne)
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Uh, they can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - ah, they can't fuck with me now
Look-
It ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge
Try to take 'em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Ah, fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
They can't fuck with me now - them can't fuck with me now
Stop playin' when ya get it understood
'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You don't know me - I kill everyone who show love
You have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya
Ah, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now
Them can't fuck with me now - no, they can't fuck with me now

(Lil Wayne)
Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga
Can't fuck with me now - it's not a game, nigga
Wha, wha, uh, uh, nigga!

Suck the dick till the shit in her chest
You can piss on her brest

Project hoes like that dick, Don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish sweet hoe
Black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, Specialize in givin' me deep throat
Really don't care how short how plump, short or thick
Give me head, Don't care, Swallow cum don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it
Its off tha chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain
But watch them hoes who want the change
It's not a game
Or short cuban hoe, With a fat ass though
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro

(UnPlugged)
Tell me what you like
Let me tell you what I like
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
'Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

(Lil Wanye)
Weezy the hottest
Drinkin' Barcadi
I stream through the scene on a Lincon on Robbers
Lookin' for the finest dime, To wine and dine

Hold up lil mama, Slow ya ass down
Pick it up, Throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around
An scream me name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame
Better watch that boy he nasty

Break ya off like elastic
Put the dick in the middle, Make it wiggle for y'all
Might be small, But that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, Fat ass an shit
Like Taso flip like Trina The Baddest Bitch
Matter of fact when I see her, Pull her Over like a cop
Juve coulda Backed It Up an I woulda Dropped It Like Its Hot
Ha Ha, Ya heard me

(Mannie Fresh)
I like them big, round, yellow and brown
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride till you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut
Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, Hold up ???
My bitch got thong, You bitch got drawls
My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop
My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend
From vigina to the asshole do it again

Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome
You ok Lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love me dick

(Lil Wayne)
Look look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

(Hook (Lil Wayne))
Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

(Lil Wayne)
What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
'Cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
And passin' a blunt - me circle once to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you are with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

(Hook (Lil Wayne))
Bet' not play with me 'cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
Then I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
Then I pop my gun
Better hide and run

(Lil Wayne)
You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'ma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'ma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Wheezy killaholeezy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

(Hook (Lil Wayne))
Bet' not play with me 'cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Nigga, bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
Then I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me - boy, I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
Then I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
Then I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me - boy, I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
Niggas bet' not play with me 'cause I cock my gun
Then I pop my gun
Better hide and run

Niggas bet' not play with me
Look, uh-huh (uh-huh uh-huh)
Look look look
Look look look

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Geezy, Juve and Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg

Age is nothin' but some digits nigga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L in the C L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every whip, cas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catchin bites to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I light me a spliff drink henney without ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin' I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly
And I know I might be young but niggas gone definitely respect me
But in the mean time I'm fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
It's like I'm never happy now
Except for the fact my daughter sayin' I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts
And puff a Kool it boost me up
And say a prayer for everyday
Just so I get through the stuff but I be like

Ah man, it's complicated doin' everythang on your own man
Being responsible for everybody in ya home man
And when you feel like everythang is goin' wrong man
I'm gone stand 'cause I am a GROWN MAN

I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm fed up thinkin' everythang's a set up
But I get up this shit, stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall
And I'm walkin' on the edge stuck without a solution
And someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion
And I don't need nobody else so keep yo advice and jus doubt me
Cas y'all cats don't really no me y'all jus no 'bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me covered with spirit
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through

Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say it's a game
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of them family first 'cause the liquir and weed is a habit
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
And I'm faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone
And dawg I do believe I'm grown
So I'll be good on my own but I be like

(Chorus) fading... Believe Dat

Yellow Viper, yellow Hummer, Yellow Benz
Yellow PT Cruiser, yellow 'Lac on rims
Drop yellow 'Vette and a platinum Rolls Royce
That's seven different cars, everyday I got a choice
On my way to pick up Joyce, she be makin' me moist
Givin' me head while she hummin, she can play with her voice
And she got nice thighs, a big plump ass
She could ride a dick too, make me come fast
I like them modelin bitches, I love them swallowin bitches
Where them hoes, there they at, I'm 'bout to follow them bitches (let's go)
I know you with your folks, but that nigga is broke
You might as well open your legs up and let a nigga poke
I'm a show you what it is not to be a window shopper
Mama you can have Fendi, mama you can have Prada
All you gotta do is break a nigga off proper
You could be with your man, I ain't tryna stop ya

(Chorus-Baby)

Baby named me, fire Wayne, ice and change
You can catch me in an aqua Range, squattin things
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades
Diamond face, diamond brace
More colors than the game Simon Says
Go, 'hind me
And mami on forty-fifth she told me "I'm a Lez"
But she ain't like too much of dick
But gave bombest head, and so I took it anyway
But bitch I got family get your pussy anyway
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin
All these karats like I'm a fuckin' vegetarian
Niggas play, I bury them, y'all already knowin'
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin
See I'm a keep it goin', Big Tymin, you heard's me?
Dog I got cake like everyday my birthday
Wait, I don't think they heard me
I say dog I got cake like everyday my birthday

I'm a Hot Boy, that's name brand and top of the line
Ride fly daily, all year 'round I shine
Ain't a nigga and they mama gonna stop me dog
Come through on dub-dueces, they jock me dog
Glock cocked for haters tryna block me dog
Catch 'em so low, they geezy, don't shock me dog
Well get the fuck, slide on out the way
And let B.G. ease down the shinin linen
Let the diamonds and the jewelry light shit up
Each piece of jewelry I own, I ice it up
You don't wanna put your vehicle next to us
'Cause all of our vehicles, we dress 'em up
With television, Dreamcast, DVDs
Nice sounds, buttons, it's twenties
I'm a Cash Money Hot Big Tymer nigga
That'll hold a pinky finger up and blind ya nigga

(Turk)
I'm a stunt till I die, so you better respect it
'Cause whoever try testin is gonna be restin
I'm a young millionaire, Hot Boy, Lil' Turk
Bling blingin everyday, plus I got work (bling)
Nigga like me stay in the cut twenty-four/seven
Steady stackin my ends on dubs, twenty-four/seven
Every car you wish you had, we got it, we got it
Bentleys, Hummers and Jags, big bodies, big bodies
Love to floss, no secret stun'ner's
Niggas steady baller block, can't take nothin' from us
Young nigga, livin' a life surrounded by ice
Hoes be like, "Damn, them boys, they're nothin' nice"
They on fire, that must be them Hot Boys
You muthafuckin right, you think this not girl?
Better think twice, get it right dog
Know you recognize, we got it on lock for all

Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

I tell 'em no lie
I blow by wit the Bentleys wit the O eyes
I low-ride, 'cause these 20 inch rims just make it so hot
You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car for it cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice "Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing"
I'm tryin' to see flying in a Lamborghini
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini
Cut the music down and tell her, "hey ya man's a weenie"
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough
Pull out my bankcard and Bill Gates feel broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal
And a frost bit wrist, have me sniffin and coughin

Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump,
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

You know, pistol on my side fully loaded
I drive slowly, wit televisions watching Kobe
Pull over by some broad; make her hop right in a blow me
And suck a nigga drive, then its, "slut get out my ride"
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin' and pimped out, flossin and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm thawin my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van,
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that
I make 'em:

Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jump
Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive

All right I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover
Just put TV's and bump in the Rover
Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick just bogus
Fuck a hoe watch she come back like a chorus
Life on Ann Deloris met her in a ???
She like to snort coke, you should see the size of her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
All our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
'Cause every time you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'

Life of a suburban kid
Existentialism
I ain't never care much for esoteric shit
He said "I ain't got no real thoughts"
I could use some adderall in my green tea
Some ice up in my soymilk
I keep an angel on my shoulder devil in my head
He said...

Violate the bounds of platitude [2x]
Who do I do it for?
Who do I do it for?
I hope I do it for you

Try to fight the numbness
Still don't have an answer
Figure when I die it will make sense
Maybe God will answer
Until then

I'm drowning in this world of platitude
Feel like I'm drowning in this world of platitude
What do I do it for?
What do I do it for?
Maybe I do it for you
Baby I do it for you

Little red man leaving my head
Lay around in my dreams
Come alive in my nightmares
Ignore my rambles
Hoping that you hear me
Hoping that I'm heard
If your not careful
I'll take scissors to my mind
Scissors to my mind
Snip snip

Tell me what you want from me yeah
For you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
Baby I do it for you
Tell me what you want from me yeah
For you
Tell me what you want from me yeah

Pain reliever
Fever reducer
Ten to the head
Does that make me a loser?
I took nine shots of that fifth
Gone gone gone
Eight hits of that spliff
Gone I got
Seven reasons why I'm not sure of six things
On my mind and I'm comin' off this high five

Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

Second verse on my third beer
Kill all these voices that I feel I hear
Mob to the bride, I'm
Keeping the faith, I'm
Holding the fight, A
Hell of a night
It's a hell of a night

Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

Only when I'm alone
Only when I was on one
(One one one one)
Live like I'm living today
Live like today was my last one
(One one one one)

Falling from this high
(Falling falling)
From this high
(One one one one)

Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

I'm tired of time travel
I rather stay here with my thoughts
Wish they'd stay
Misunderstood
I'm miseducated
Umm
You should just save me

I just wanna live
How it should be
Over
What it is
Over
Can I get a heartbreak
Over
Unstick my thoughts
Unstick my heart
Unstick these words
Go from the start

Take me to reality
And drag me to the truth
Take me to reality
Drag me to the truth

Come clean, soul
Yearning for things, are numb
Do me good then jus so
Look with the light, I see
Top of my sight I'm scared
Can't sleep at night

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'd rather die than, be your slave
Slit my wrist wide and take this stage
Wipe blood out my eyes and
You just lay, there
You think I'm crazy... I am

I love you like I love crack-crack (I do)
I love you like I like to get high (I do)
I love you like I love crack-crack (I do)
I love you like I like to get high

I'm just a unicorn
Come catch me
Strip me in chains until I bleed
You know I like it
That's why should I stay here
Why should I fight it?
I won't, I won't

Chosen from a small town
Lookin' for some action
Thought I could [?]
But I can't
I just crave the pain boy
I just love the thrill

I'd do for you
Anything
I'd do anything

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale, this here is the epic tale

And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

I hear my thoughts, I hear them creep into my mind, into my dreams
Voices in my head say to me, "Untie my hands, untie my feet"
So I might fly, so I might fly

This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale

And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

Like clouds under my feet I try not to think
Not to feel like I'm stuck in this space I'm just me
I'm just so much more, so much more, so much
I'm so much more, I feel I'm so much more
(Feel like I'm so much more)

One day if I live I'll tell the tale how I lost my mind
One day, one day if I live
One day if I live I'll tell the tale how I lost my mind
One day, one day if I live

And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

I'll be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your side
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your

Lost my mind, can't seem to find it but I'll be here
But I'll be here though

Wish I was prettier a little for ya
Maybe I'll understand when I get older
I just don't get it yet
I'm not finished yet

Feel like maturity is overrated
None of my panties match my momma hates it
I'm not into that
She just don't get it yet

Whooo could I be?
Passions clearer for me, me, me, me
So
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me if it's easier for YOU
Tell me if it's easier for ya
Tell me it gets easier for me

Shattered a thousand times before you found me
Kickin the pieces I bet I'll never amount to
Anything, I just don't get it yet
Not meant to get it yet

Boxes and paradigms I move around it
Spaces inside your mind I'm safe and sound where
I can breath, I feel, I can breath
Don't leave me yet!

Whoooo could I be
Visions clearer for me, me, me, me

Tell me if it's easier for you... [3x]
Tell me it gets easier for me

Sandcastles and all that shit that I like

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Picture yourself in a padded room
Welcome to my terror dome
Picture yourself in a padded room
Welcome to my terror dome

Figured you'd had enough of being alone
Figured you call me
Glinda, ya good witch
...Sensei, Ya good bitch
I'll be there
Call me when ya ready

Uh
I'll be ya good witch call me
Uh
I'll save ya if I can call me

Not frightened after you trust your own thoughts
Catch the Delirium, contagious
I think I owe you more
I feel I show you more
You're my eight packs of soft
Savor like a now or later
I think about you now or later

I'll be your savior, call me
Catch you if I can, call me

Feel I've gone far
Tell me where to go from here
Little girl, Lost boy
That's how I feel
Sail me away

Picture yourself

Just picture yourself
Picture yourself
Picture yourself
Picture yourself in a candy land
I wanna go there, alone
All of the morphine you can stand
Padded rooms
Picture yourself

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I apologize for waiting to tell you for so long
I am not human
I am made of bacon, fairy tales, pixie dust, I don't feel
I hung myself and didn't die
I'm omnipotent, I'm alive
Not real, I'm alive

You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

Caught up in the blast
Caught up in the action
Caught up in the bursting flame
There's comfort in dying
There's comfort in burning I burn

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby
Living as a unicorn gets so lonely
I have no answers
I have No questions
Stuck in your tandem
Heat that's worth standing
I like it

I can feel the accidents happening slowly
Falling for the rapture ever so boldly
I will go willingly
You don't have to kidnap
I'd like to be kidnapped
You leave me careless, I like it
I like it

Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn
Maybe we should burn, burn

Doubt I'll ever be anyone's baby

Can anyone live with Eartha Kitt?

That's not for me to decide. That's for someone who decides to live with me to decide. Not for me

But are you willing to compromise within a relationship?

To compromise? What is compromising? Compromising for what? Compromising for what reason? To compromise? For what? To compromise. What is compromise?

If a man came into your life, wouldn't you want to compromise?

Stupid. A man comes into my life and I have to compromise? You must think about that one again.
A man comes into my life and you have to compromise? For what? For what? For what? A relationship is a relationship that has to be earned! Not to compromise for! And I love relationships. I think they're fantastic. But one thing I think that's great I think is, nothing in the world more beautiful than falling in love. But falling in love for the right reasons. Falling in love for the right purpose. Falling in love. Falling in love. When you fall in love, what is there to compromise about?

Ise' got to make this quick
I don't want to waste time
Make it faster, stronger, deeper
Pulled out with the passion rolled out
Roll out on the red carpet
Roll out the chariot
Friar, dancing
By the fire
Singing
I'm leaving, tonight
I'm leaving tonight
I'm leaving tonight tonight
Yeah
Haven't we been here before
Haven't you heard the end of the story?
It isn't over yet
Keep patience on the left side of your brain
Virtues are relative
No pain
(Alright)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Young Medusa
Never sure, I just do
I jumped off the bridge
You say I fell
I say I flew
Missing parachute
Feeling like topanga
Patty mayonnaise
Kind of average
With queen qualities
Got molecules, I possess
Ever more nothing less

I think I'm starting to feel something
Here in the dark
I think I'm starting to feel something

Keep burning up
Pray for yourself one time
One time, time

Broken glass unswept in my mind
Brooms to heavy to bare
Struggles that I find
Confusion
Gravity is relative
Sand castles are still real life
They hold dreams
Like the real ones do
I take care building castles too

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Summertime sadness
I feel India in my bones
I can smell sunlight
I can feel the highline
Bless me
Gods bless me
Goddess of Forbidden Love
I am she
I keep one white candle
Maintain
Purity, purity

Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go go go there
Go to church if you scared

I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets
Star signs say I'm rare
Chosen
By who
I-I-I-I-I
I wonder who's watchin'
Whose wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me
I'll go!

Show me the way
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea

Wouldn't you like to believe
I'm on the edge
I feel your power on my back
You're murderous, you're murderous
Swept and I fall, euphoria
Breeze in my eyes
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

So painless, I feel the fall
Power trip, I need it all
I need it all

When you're around, I feel it
When I'm alone, I feel the waves
Crashing, down down
Here in your arms, surround me
I feel your wings

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Keep your intentions pure don't be scared don't mince words
I don't mince words
My narcissism keeps me level
Keeps me straight no curve balls
Got no curve balls stay straight here
You wish that I was less than I am
Less than I will be but I won't
No I won't
Kismet, serendipity
Reflections
I am him and he is me
Kismet... Serendipity

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Clarity is a state of mind
Freedom ain't real, who's sold you that lie?
I ain't buying it
No matter what the price (one more time? Aight)
So give it up give it up mama
Undo your pants and your bra
I see you liking that, you must need a slice...
Type A personality
Extrovert, introvert, commonalities
A Type A personality
Just dumb enough to lie to me

U R, U R (We, Are...)

Superficial, Superwoman
Ain't you tired of that wind in your face?
Your skin taste likes brussell sprouts I swear
Can't seem to remember your face
So give it up give it up papa
Make it make sense to me
I can not go any further then 2 steps in-front of me
I'm lost in...

Ripping the heads off all my Barbie dolls
Toss them to the side, give them convertibles
Click vroom, I like the way it rides up
Ken had it all, Skipper wanted more than
Watching from the sidelines, wish that she had it
She wish that she had it
Here in your backyard, building a fantasy
Fuck reality, do you want to know, know me
Do you want to know me?
Stuck in Nintendo, you're the controller
Street Fighter sin search
I yelled finish him
(Down goes Frazier)
I yelled, finish him
I'm Desdemona
Othello in tragedies
Shakespeare in sorrows
Where do I begin?
Where do we begin?

I got L's on my record
Weed on the vinyl
Keys open doors when them keys is albino
Now knock on my door when my stars is a Lionel
I've been fishing for a minute for a minnow
Only I know that a pawn is a trade
And a rookie for a castle like tuition for a final
Playing hooky for a tassel, spend a minute on the minor
Winds on my window
Ash on my skin, when the record low temps for the wind blow
Only write rhythm to the tardiest of tempos
Only ride shotgun when the car is a limo
Y'ar see
I crowd surf in a cypher
Scuba in my shower, take an Uber to my neighbors
Used to pay the piper, till peter picked it better
Now the first thing you should tell is where the hell is all the paper
But memories keep coming back
All the nights that we used to laugh
Wanna know how I used to was, how I used to was

Memories keep playing back, all the nights we used to love
Just wondering how we used to was, how we used to was

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Here soon, here soon

Loving alone is what you make it (make it)
Stay for the storm if you can take it (take it)
But pray for a raincoat
Go up to where they're blind to
Mistakes
I know you worry a lot
I'll be here for you
Do I care enough?
Do I feel for you?
I can guarantee

Come on, this one

I didn't know you tried
Cause you wanted more
And didn't know you cried
Cause you wanted more
Things don't happen the way you hoped to
I'm just keeping a little hope, baby
I didn't know you tried
Cause you wanted more

Dying my daydreams in your bedroom (bedroom)
Waiting so long, said you'd be here soon (here soon)
How could you forget that
I'm the one who
Forgot all your mistakes
And dirty drawers
You know I care for you
When hell over earth came
I stood for you
Will you stand for me?

Funny how life is turning out
I don't have much to talk about
Don't have much to write about
Got a shitload to cry about
Funny the words I do kick
Funny the niggas I do pick
It's funny what sticks
(Go figure)
Mama said I'm sensitive
I gotta work on that
Not really
Tired of using adjectives, I gotta build on that
You feel me?
Not really

Young man, tryna find the world in a broken hand

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hey, hey glory child, hey

Hey glory child, don't you worry
Stuttering, shaken off your fear
Beauty's never given in a hurry
So condescending, leave your questions here
Hey glory child, don't you worry
I can see your skeleton so clear
Doubting's only made your visions blurry
You're better off just looking in the mirror

Show me a better way, I wish you could
Show me a better way, I wish you would
Come home today, you could
Come home today

I am shooting stars you will never see me
Watching over your every mistake
Digging out of graves is never easy
Handing you my shovel, here to take
Always playing catch me if you can
Gingerbread you heard I'm sweet to taste
Close your eyes let go and count to ten
I'll keep track of every moment wasted

Dear God make me a bird
So I can fly far, far far away

Call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul and it taste like
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

Quit clipping on your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul and it taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

Quit clipping on your feet
Quit clipping on your wings
Sometimes we hate to leave somebody
What's happening to we?
Warm winds on a space ride

Sometimes, I call your name out loud
Just to make sure it's you
Sometimes, I crack my veins so bad
Just to see if it's blue
You clean me up

Sometimes I bite my lips and close my eyes
Just to pretend it's you
Long live, lonely thoughts on Thursday nights
That's when I think of you
We were all thirteen once
Long live tramp stamps and Pepper Ann
You will never judge me for that
You will always love me for that

Warm winds on a space ride
When I call your phone on a late night
I recall your soul and it taste like...
Gardens, flowers, Warm Winds

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Go forth, spread the news
I'm a little late
Go on, cut the rope
I know you hate it
Two knives, no fork
Wonder who'd make it?
I lose for you, I choose for you

Gun fighting
Fatality, boy
Hell fire, boy
I stay for eternity

For you, for you
For, for you I stay
For you, for you
For, for you I

Sometimes I keep you in my mind
Sometimes I let you go up high
I'm using everything I find
Do anything to keep you tied up
Tied up

Stationary, birds await
Small canary, princess
Young savage girl, lost among the lily pads
One road no choice, I've given you this
Move moons for you, I choose to do it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Shotgun to the back of my heart
I don't turn around to see who let one ring out
Said you'll never do me wrong?
Guess we see how that plays out
Is it true? Is it true?

Heading to the Massacre
Bodies arriving every day
Look at those shells you heard
Picking the bones up along the way
Let it ring out

Sharpshooter in my backyard
Killed a small boy once, never told no one
If it wasn't for my shotgun, he'd be alive
And I'd be halfway, to heaven
Instead of sitting in the dark, going through hell
You should've been here
Wish you had been here

Shotgun to the back of my heart
I don't turn around to see who let one ring out

Lately I've been questioning
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it, I doubt it
Lately I've been questioning
Am I all that I pretend to be?
I doubt it, I doubt it

Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway?
Not me

Are you hating yourself?
Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired?, of always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

Kendrick Lamar:
Cross my heart then I hope to die with a peace of mind (a peace of mind)
Piece together my brain soon as this beat rewind (beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane I spike your drink at times (turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game, you throw up every line (every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes, that's my confession (yeah that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing that I'm beyond desperate (yeah that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours
My apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down &amp; Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean there's no pretending I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended
That's life, that's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, I'm a new blood type, even colder
Cold shoulder, Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose, my dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini go show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired?, of always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway, spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway?
You're mine any day
It's burning
Take me
I wanna feel
Your power
This final hour
Tell me

Are you losing yourself?
Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

Was it worth it?
Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired?, of always making amends? Oh
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)

Jesus called me collect last night
It took all of me not to answer
Daddy warned me the perils of play
Hard to deal God it's his standard
Flying high and fearless baby
I've kissed death a thousand times before

Remember me for who I was not who I am
I'll pray you never understand this
Sweet, sweet, sweet sweet November

Heard you fucking with Tommy again
Remember where that landed you last time
That nigga don't really love you girl
He just beds you every night it's his past-time
Blind eye and the feel is dark and
You two might just do it raw tonight
Heaven help if he leave you girl
I bet you bought two new thongs this time

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's up for discussion, up for reprise
Slowly re-thinking if current disguise deceives me
The Shattered Ring
I can see it in your eyes

Ready or not, loaded heart with a dagger
Aim for your sweet spot
I know you'd rather be scared of
I know you'd rather just disappear
Now that I'm here
I know you'd rather

Giddy up Goldilocks, you took too long to save me
Bumping that Jadakiss is dangerous for sanity
Open my candy box, for you sir, sugar daddy
Look at how drunk we are, spent the night, dancing
(Spent the night, dancing)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Let the church say Amen
Release all my sins at the pulpit
It's the beginning [8x]
It's the beginning of my sermon
You hold my hand as an infant
Palms to the sky, Adonai, Ya Allah
Till they all come down
Till we all fall down
Down...

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride

Up here, the air is so thin
Mountains on my fingertips
I stand at the tippy, screaming at the top of my lungs
Tears in my eyes
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you hear me?
Adonai, Ya Allah, answer my calls if you're near me?

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

When you don't know yourself
If it hurts you to explain
You're God in my eyes
Just ride

Lines drawn in the sun
Keep the sun at your back
Keep your feet firmly planted in the sky
Just ride

It's the beginning

spoken:
That is my greatest fear
That if, if I lost control
Or did not have control, things would just, you know
I would be... fatal

I'm writing this letter to let you know
I'm really leaving
And no I'm not keeping your shit
Heard you got some new homies
Got some new hobbies
Even a new hoe too
Maybe she can come help you
Maybe she can come lay do
After we're done
What's done is done
I don't want nothing else to do with it
Let me tell you a secret
I been secretly banging your homeboy
Why you in Vegas
All up on Valentine's Day?
Why am I so easy to forget like that?
It can't be that easy for you to get like that
Oh no she didn't
Ooh yes I did
Oh no she didn't
I'll do it again

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention
For shit like that
You know you wrong
For shit like that
I could be your supermodel
If you believe
If you see it in me
See it in me
See it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you
I need you
I need you

Ooh just get a load of them
They got chemistry
All they could say
We like brother and sister
Look so good together
Bet they fuckin' for real
And they was right
That's why I stayed with ya
The-the dick was too good
It made me feel good
For temporary love
You was a temporary lover

Leave me lonely for prettier women
You know I need too much attention
For shit like that
You know you wrong
For shit like that
I could be your supermodel
If you believe
If you see it in me
See it in me
See it in me
I don't see myself
Why I can't stay alone just by myself?
Wish I was comfortable just with myself
But I need you
I need you
I need you

Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it, oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Whoa, just shut up, know you're my favorite
Am I...

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect and soak in it right

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
(Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya)
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

Warm enough outside, inside
Warm enough outside, inside me-me-me-me, me-me-me
Oh-whoa, is it warm enough outside, inside?

Fearin' not growin' up
Keepin' me up at night
Am I doin' enough?
Feel like I'm wastin' time

Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please, please
Don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
Darling, like I know you will

Forget to call your mama on the weekend
You should put yourself in time out
Shame, shame on you
But lately you've been feelin' so good
I forget my future, never pull out
Shame, shame on me
Baby the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere
So far away
Hoppin' through poppy fields
Dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now it's really pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, take it personal
Like I know you usually do

Like winters fall on us, heavy
Take it off me, all it off
Winter, I can't stand this
Snow is falling all on me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You know, a lot of people ask me
Why I feel, that, you know
I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And, umm, I don't know
People seem to be under the impression
That, I made it to this point, FAST
And, y'know obviously for me
I don't feel like that 'cause it's me y'know
I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years
But, every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far
Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten
Until you look around and, and you look at the people who
Who, who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that, that no matter what, it's
In the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know
It's not gonna be about my connections
It's not gonna be about my looks
It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most
Annnnd, I want it the most!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I just came out of the muthafuckin' old school
Got my mac notebook with the pro tools
Y'all bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof flyer then a frisby
So I'm up in (?) eating mangoes
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star they say wen I star spangle
But for buh; buh; buh; buh
I-I-I-I am the the the rap Hannah
Ma Mon-Montana so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then reindeers in the winter

I get crazy
I get crazy

Nicki Minaj:
So I got the bad bitch mentality 'cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the oval office then the lights out
'Cause I am the wicked witch I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my jickster
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I am Nicki LMNO-winsky
I mean my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean tinker
Tell that nigga link her
'Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

Weezy:
1 2 3rd Floor
Hospital Bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straight jacket crooked, I hear you lookin'
I promise I'm hard, and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes I am
Right up in the coo-coo nest I land
I'm' fly now eat my bird shit
Yeah I'm crazy, I'm' crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm looking for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F. Baby, no, Weezy F. Crazy

I got my mind on my money and I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper.

Brinx:
Now you hold it your excellence
See I t.c oh forward slash president
East side resident oh so evident
Brinx Billy ride cousin black on black phantom 26s on the side of 'em
Ninas on the side of em, goonies on the side of 'em
Anybody can get it boy be careful on the side of them
These niggas are burial guns no fearial
Money hungry honey with me if you holla she gonna carry you
Flyer than a aerial vechical gerital
Sittin' on my feet when I'm stuntin' on them people
I tell no fables everything chillin'
Fax machines office max see me for that paper
You workin' for short bread ain't my money long younging
Bitch I'm on trappin' more digits than a phone number different time zones on 'em Kill them niggas lyrically
Left side of my closet look invaded by Italy
Right side Paris left side flaggin' paper is my main chick me and money married
And that's all a nigga know bitch that's why them brand new niggas is all up on my old shit

(Speaking: Nicki Minaj)
That's what I did I came up out the truck, you know what I'm sayin'

Young Money, Nicki Minaj it's the ninja, Harajuku Barbie and all of that
Nah I'm sayin' all that me gettin' money you writin' disses we gettin' money

Hit me my limousine, all in your magazine
And when I come them better lean like Promethazine

And tell Michelle I got my eye on Barack Obama
Tryna get that Madonna, you know, Hannah Montana
And you can find me sittin' Indian style with the Dalai Lama
Konichiwa I get my yin and say sayonara
I'm meditating, I'm in conhoots with a higher power
Mind on money mi-mi-mind on my money yo
Mind on my money mi-mi-mind (yo ho rai que quo)
Mind on money aye, mind on my money babe
How does this money taste? Whining on money's face
You see the signs and the teachings
If you ain't know well this is grinding season
Now and go get your gangs signs, throw it up!
Where all my niggas on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't going away
My niggas bring the heat, it's not a summer day
So mind on my motherfuckin' money, my mind on my motherfuckin' money.

(Speakin: Busta Rhymes)
Ayo I speak foreign languages and shit but the language I speak is that money language (laughs) flipmode bitch
Brinx I like how we do the brinx truck job on these niggas homey
Time after time again I like niggas and remind niggas how I hold out on motherfuckers

Niggas out here frontin' about they bread you can't trust it niggas my money so Stupid call me warren Busta buss nigga
Glad it ain't a toss and everything about me butters I've been counting money so Long I see dollar signs and different colors
My money is smear and smothered your money you hear me brother
Been about that bread like I was broke or still in the gutter
And in case you ain't know there will be no replacement and them bags of arab Money I got stashed in the basement face it

Two sticks in my bun, but, but first of all

And I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
Cause y'all y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday you already know, y'knahmsayin?

Yo, SB. I think it's my time...
You know why? My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed
Against me will prosper. And I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm still the one to beat
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!

Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down!)
Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or a real real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the Tec 9
Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex line
Hit 'em with a tommy so my niggas call me Kimmy and I always the jammy in the Trunka of the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei
So I call him splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis (?)
This is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinsky
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me)

If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'm a go hard
If you was as real as me, you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin' around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!

Lil Wayne:
From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me just like vibe and no water
Better yet, like Bubba, no shrimp. but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm that just a summa bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
It yee ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't cover my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nick
It ain't fuckin' with me it ain't fuckin' with Nick
Your girlfriend, her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nick, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my Le Bitch (?) cause, I swear y'all's a fuckin' trip
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger just punch a bitch
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country bitch

Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'm a go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin' around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end

Taking me out just to ask how my day went

Hear the Devil callin',
I can hear em,
It's like I get chills down my spine when I'm near him,
Mad, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him,
I don't need the preachers,
I'm the high priestess.
Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you.",
Bxtches know I beast this,
I'm the fashionistist.
And they know I stay around the white like a groom,
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom.
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high on my own supply,
Yellin' "Rasta, all right! " when I'm ridin' by,
See I used to be the wife of a king,
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.
Now that I'm a boss bxtch,
It's a win-win,
Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin,
Now I get'cha ching and my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding.

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' [x2]

Get down, get down, get down down,
Get d- get down, get down, get down down,
Get down, get down, get down down,
Get down, get down on the ground,
Get down, get down on the ground.

Man, fxck a P0,
And fxck a C0,
'Bout to set it off like Cleo,
Mad they done tapped my trio,
Begged my skio,
Heard the bxtch lyin' like Leo.
Anyway, I'm the ninja,
Kawasaki blazin',
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians.
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son,
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done.
'Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin',
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I am every woman.
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in,
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my auntie,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' [x2]

Can you hear the yellin'?
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e.
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me.

I switched up the interior in my European 50
Damn Gucci lyrical
Nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria,
With brand new material
Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were richer than a year ago with
Three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was error and rude same color as a prune yellow
Chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Roon hearing ert-ert when it skert 26's on the skirt's
And a bird with a flirt
You can tirt I got twerk I keep work
In my birds I got bird I got bricks

Excuse me mister put some cheeries in my cups

Where that white blow, why they copy my flow
If it's not young money, it's a typo
There them lights go, we don't talk to five-o

We don't t-t-talk, talk 2 five-o

I'm sorry I don't wanna take a walk with ya
Matta fact, I ain't tryna talk 2 ya
We ain't got no business, so what we talkn for
It ain't no need to bring me in for no interrogation
Cause about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving?
At the precinct writing statements on which your house is the station (damn)
Not I, tattle tellin' is for homos
Besides, that's the number 1 Young Money no no
Police, we don't chat with them
We ain't got no wrap for them
You in the cop car point niggas out from the back of them (There he go)
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I'm black, and yous a fuckin' goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the half way house and ask your supervisor

Yes uh huh, Washington
Betta ask around, 'cause I'm what's popping-ton

DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck 'em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect 'em
I could AK attack 'em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
'Cause I'm God's gift like a present

C'mon now, they done... they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done
Two sticks in my bun, but, but first of all
When I say two sticks in my bun, I mean
That when I put a bun in my hair
Like when I put my hair in a ponytail
And I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
Cause y'all y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit

Y'know behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly, girl
There's a really sweet, Harajuku Barbie, and umm

Why you was secretive? frontin' like you friendly

They say she got colder than igloos. did she?

Just left Mr. Miyagi tell that bitch jump if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when the bell go DING!

I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nic of time it just dawned on
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win
Maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me 'cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill

Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D.
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah follow the rules, go and say my prayers and get ready for school)

Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?

Yeah yeah uh huh
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin'

She call herself Lewinsky, that mean she give him brain
She trynna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks tha same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she frum Queens right?
And what's her nationality, she Chinese right?
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT
She ain't da next bitch, tell dat bitch fall back!
See I'm a hater, I go hard... listen let's begin
You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian
And she ain't neva comin' out, look at currency
But every time she do a interview you know I run to see
She get me so sick it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up thisis50... MTV... hit up BET
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki

Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day you'll remember dis
One day wen we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is, good enough for music biz

For you, for you

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens for me that means you
Just gotta a betta opportunity to do you
They don't understand these labels look at numbers is statistics
I lose, you lose, mines just legastic
Any way, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetins (kyea)
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Common, you can ask Chris
Lady when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's duckin' the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swirvin the mazeratzi
Stay around da white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-poppin' on my poppers so the cops see... BITCHES!

Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I mite crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!

I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin 
So far ahead, these bums is laggin' 
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin' 
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon 
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin' 
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been? 
Yeah, I said it, has-been 
Hang it up, flatscreen 
(Haha) Plasma 
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma 
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine 
I got bars, Xenocin 
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt 
And I'll kick that hoe, punt 
Forced trauma, blunt 
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front 
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it 
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with 
You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock 
I am a movie, camera block 
You outta work, I know it's tough 
But enough is enough 

I feel Pretty (3x) 
And witty 
And Gay
And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight 

(Eminem) 

I ain't into S&amp;M, but my whip's off the chain 
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame 
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain 
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame 
You don't like it then peel off, bitch 
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut 
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off 
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off 
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod 
Quit hollerin' "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it 
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad 
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra 
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch 
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad 
With fake tits and a bad dye job 
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad 
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod 
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed 
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her 
Look, two pees and a tripod! 
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod? 
Kick it back in its face, my God 
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd 
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) 

I feel uglyx3

Slut don't touch me or hug me 
I'm mad And I pity Any girl who gets with me tonight 

(Nicki Minaj) 

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight? 
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite 
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike 
Now all my ***** gettin' bucked, overbite 
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's 
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs 
I call the play, now do you see why? 
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli 
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin' 
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin' 
Overseas, church, Vatican 
You at a stand, still, mannequin 

(Eminem) 

All you li'l faggots can suck it 
No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets 
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend 
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if 
You have the same passion that I have 
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass 
You assdicks had gastric bypass 
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass 
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!) 
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony 
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass 
You know what time it is, so why ask? 
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class 
It's (high class) meets (white trash) 

I feel Pretty (3x) 
And witty 
And Gay 
And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight

Yo

So I came down and had to pick up my crown 
Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand 
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound 
Baddest under ground since Harriet Tub 
That's why when I come around they hurry and run 
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one 
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns 
Yao Ming, Imma need a couple Asians 
Sayonara bitches on that kawasaki blazin, 
Ayo Rihanna gotta come up off dem bajans 
Call Wyclef imma need a couple haitians

I wanna get to know you
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you crazy

(Young Buc)
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)

(Lloyd Banks)
Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady

I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

(50 Cent)
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla tonight

I wanna get to know you
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, lady
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy

(x2)
I wanna be your lover
I really understand you, baby
I want to be your lover
I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of 
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me "Mama", "Lil' Mama", I call him "Baby"...

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)

You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of 
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Mm-hmm... yo... yo...
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon,
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)

Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Find me in the dark, I'll be in the stars;
Find me in your heart - I'm in need of your love...
Your love... your love, your love...
Baby, you're the illest...
Your love...

Your love...

Yo Cassie
You a bad bitch I'mma call you Lassie
Just left the tour last date Tallahasse
Don't mind me
Even witcha GPS couldn't find me
Lookin' at this boy I'mma call him McDreamy
I was wonderin' if he got a good Dick Cheney
Got a Lamborghini so the doors go high
In a button down Chris Brown bow tie!

(Cassie's part...)

Is that my cue
I'm lookin' for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2
My SAT sc-scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag, I Loui Vuitton bagged him

Hopped out the jag proceeded to shag-shagged him
Thought he was a queen I dr-dr-dragged him
Dodged to the room and whipped out the magnum
Slim, trim, also light skin
Now P-P-Peter put the pipe in
Yes sir I am that bitch
Fuck you Silly like the rabbit
*Giggles*
Giddy Up Giddy Up
Now wake Diddy up Diddy up Diddy up
Young Money Nicki
Badboy Cassie

(Nicki)
I got that hard Gucc
You know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu
I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi
I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm taking trips with papi
You walkie talkie copy
I got them pookie feins
Might rock some juicy jeans
I mean some juicy sweats
Maybe some lose your giusepp's
I play foul no free throw
Bitch I ball no pre-show
Dead ass no peep show!
Brought a run pronto
With a front condo
Daughter, son, John Doe
Watching tele-mundo
Flyer than a rocket
Money in my Polly Pocket
What you copping
Keep that work inside my Pippy Long Stockings
Bitch!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's not chipped, we're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered
Mariah, Young Money
Nicki Minaj, you're such a Barbie

Yo, Mariah, I was in a million dollar meetin' he was cheatin'
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away while the mice will play
L-O-L, smiley-face, have a nice day

'Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop censoring that contraband
'Cause you was penny-pinchin', my accounts laced
Attention, about-face

I thought we had something special and we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walkin' by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you're on a sofa and I'm on the TV

Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo

Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house

When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby, I break

So look who's cryin' now, boo-hoo-hoo
Talkin' about you're missin' your boo, hoo-hoo
I know you ain't getting it, I know you ain't hittin' it
No, you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spittin' it

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you'll wonder who I'm messin' with
While you ain't next to me
I'm going bye, so pay the consequences
'Cause you acting all ignorant

So you ashamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house, when I break, I break

Stylin' on them big B's with the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top dogs, yeah, we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose

They be like, "She next", Kawasaki, T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left? Let his momma pick it up
Might back-up on it, vroom-vroom, with a pick-up truck

That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmello Jag
I bob and weave and hit them with the Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like I'm hotter than a yellow tag

'Cause when I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this s***
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder can rebuild this s**

When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two lego blocks even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again

When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
(I told you, I put, I put your stuff on the side walk)
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
(I will go over every nook and cranny with a pick-up truck)
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
(Like straight up and down, this is Nicki Minaj, if they ask about me, Young Money)
They're collecting my bags, baby, I break boy

Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break

Hit the club on them jiggas, you know all my niggas geeked

Met this plug, I was talking 'bout he put that thing on me

You my dawg then just be my dawg and don't you change on me
Don't you switch, don't you change on me, no switching lanes on me

Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping.
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucker kitchen using baby bottles for the lean
Wifey says I'm tripping, plus I got maybelline smeared right bellow my zipper,
I'm a Kama Sutra reader and a conjure drinker.
Hot on the stove, smoking like reefer
This work ain't bout shit, that's why it's cheaper.
This ho ain't bout shit, that's why she's cheaper,
All we blow is strong, that's why you weaker!
Wait up, yo status change when you wait up,
Waiting on the meal, I already put my plate up!
Nigga fall back up, already put my rake up,
Every time I leave the booth they put yellow tape up.
Hair weave killa, messing up her make-up,
Pyrex vision and I'm about to cook a cake up.
Get a 4, add a lil water,
Get her in a track, and ride her like a motor!

Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing.

Drive a solid gold Rolls to the Rose Bowl.
Rose in the club for my rose home!
Man fuck these niggas I got blow goals,
I count money all night, I need some no-doze,
Here to try, I want it easy, I need a bankroll
All the money I the trunk, bitch the bank roll
I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen, nigga,
Got me standing at that water like I'm fishing, nigga!
Never know about me, I pull a bass out
Drop a 250 in and pull a half out
Had to do it for the town and the trap niggas
Me and 2 chains, it's over for you rap niggas!
And nothin' says butter like parkay
And nothin' make them J's stutter like hard yay

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen,
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing.
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen,
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping.
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

It started in the kitchen, king of the whipping,
Denzel in glory, tear drop was missing!
Just like the roof is riding in that Chris Brown,
Two seater deuces, peeling like I skip town!
Pocket full of brick money, neck full of black gold,
Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like [?]
That's 2 chainz. I'm [?] I'm for everyone I cook I make [?].
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamara, 2 in the 4 like the Porsche Panamara
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, vision clouded by the coke
Ain't makin' it clearer!
I make it look easy, I rap it up greezy
Bandana around the brick, I make him look jeezy,
But I push the ton of it get the name right,
Who else could fly and then land on the same flight? Pushhh

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen,
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whiffing.
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

I go hard in the mother fucking kitchen,
Whole thang half thang, nigga I'm pitching!
Hit him with the soda make a nigga start whipping.
Hit you with a choppa make a nigga start flipping!

Yo yo... yo yo yo yooooooo... 2 Chaaaaaaaaiiiiiinnnzzzz

We gon' get it in, we gon' get it in
Started wit' a model, then I fucked her friend
Then I bought a condo, then I bought a Benz
Ballin' outta control we gon' get it in

Nigga ? bedroom try to play us on the cellphone
Ask me what's my alibi this big thick yellow redbone
Strawberry banana, we dance in our pajamas
And pose for the camera, making music no piano
Got keys on the counter, please don't get me started
Every beat I get on it end up dearly departed
Mack 11 shawty, Kawasaki balling
Tried to pop a wheelie and the Kawasaki falling
Money in my backpack, I'm too past that to go ask that
Fuck how much it cost, I got to go have that
Duck ass nigga, yeah... Aflac
And we getting paper baby can I get a hand-clap
Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap now I been booming out my traphouse
Nigga try to go and we gon' have to pull them thangs out
'Cause I got them chains out, them charms and them rings out
And if you been hustling, then we took the same route


First I bought a Beamer, then I bought some rims
Then I fucked a model, then I fucked her twin
See I don't give a fuck, we don't fuck wit' them
I'm yelling fuck the other side, we gon' get it in!
Talking on my iPhone wit' that shuffle on my iPod
Alligator belts when I flow no Izod
Walking wit' my chopper, I might need a tripod
Make ya dog look backwards nigga... my God
And know that I hustle all day
And hang on the west like Kanye
And I got techs like Georg-a, in my yellow jacket
Bitch don't act right I get her a yellow taxi
Niggas know what happen when you fucking wit' the captain
Niggas know I'm sushi, I'm raw, what's happening
Smoking on that cannabis, drinking on that lavender
And I'm getting to it every day that's on the calendar

(Okay) Free Tunechi, Yeah
2 Chainz! Hey, Hey, Hey

I got a bad bitch, she more than cute
And bitch I'm balling, I'm talking more than hoops
This is that fish scale, nigga we water-proof
I got into it with my car and I said fuck the roof
Fuck the roof, fuck the roof, fuck the roof, f-fuck the roof
Top back and I'm getting loot
Blowing smoke up in the air and saying fuck the roof

(Verse 1: 2 Chainz)
I'm in my black car chilling with my yellow ho (Yellow ho)
It's a two seater but it's known to carry fo'(Okay)
2-2 Chainz, Gucci carry-on
I got my Gucci shades, now I just carry on
And I got four zips off in my Styrofoam
See you niggas couldn't reach me on the telephone
We the two gun gang nigga, uncaged
On the front page known to leave niggas rugs stained
And I bought my mistress a sharpay
And I bought my yellow bitch a mustang (Get out of here)
Long hair, nigga no fade
And I just bought a watch that cost a whole thang


I'm blowing smoke in here, tell me where's Smokey Bear
They say I look like a chimney when I'm on the chair
I'm standing in the vip, I'm parked in the vip
I go from vip to vip so much that I'm nauseaous
Yellow ice caution, I'm cautious, yield
My girl like to wear her heels when she on the vodka
Real conversate, wine, and a lobster plate
I'm 'bout to doctor on this track, it's time to operate
Operation, dedication, time to meditate
Twenty-eight inches make this bitch levitate
I'm on a level where these other niggas feather weights
Southside, '09, rolling packs everyday

She don't like to call me Tity, she no me from back in the G
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, shit I'm hanging from the tree
Yeah, we doing all that monkey shit, that sucking and that fucking shit
And if I had another pick, I would pick the other bitch
'Cause she more like the way I like em, and this one right here ain't shit
This one might need a quilt, it's cold on the other side
Her head so fire, I hated for them other guys
Pimpin' and I'm mackin'
Actin' in the 'lac' and
If you out chea working, you ain't worth Curtis Jackson
And she cost a hunnid, for some satisfaction
And I'm just relaxing

Yeah. I got a Chevelle with a Corvette engine
Champagne, bubble bath, Moet swimming
She said, "I don't know what done got into me."
And I said, "it was me when you was on liquor"
Yeah. Blame it on the alcohol. If you don't remember that, battin' your Nigeria Falls
And when I pull em, all I have to do is call:

And you late! Faking like a fucking broad
Hair hang like a London fall, just becau'
And the wind blow, I'm hanging out the window
Windtows, pistols, and all common essentials
If a nigga talking math, he talking my lingo
And if I say I'm popping tags, I'm talking my Benzo
I'm fresh off the lot, fresh off the block

The cheapest thang I got on is my belt and it's 400
Real recognize real and you don't look familiar
If my girl worked at a spa, man she still wouldn't feel ya
Cocaine flow, they done dropped me in the pot
I came out hard and I sold out the block
Tity 2 Chainz, I been killin' hairdos

Got my mind on my moolah
My Tech 9 got a cooler

They like how the fuck you do ya
Don't make me number 2 ya
Okay, I need some Charmin
I got swag for sale and I'm giving niggas bargains
Rappers are my target

Need a handicap sticker for my 16s when I park 'em
When she in the front I make her put in reverse
And if that pussy good then I'll put it in a verse
And I'm killing these niggas, Put 'em in the dirt
And yeah, I'm killing pussy we should do it in a hearse
I woke up this morning, said I'mma get it
Turned right over and I gave that bitch the business
Hopped out the king size
My friends are green guys
Suit on, it look like I done sold bean pies
Qui-Qui-Quiet storm
I flick my lighter on
2 blunts together like an extension cord

Oh yeah we gettin' to the money (Understatement)

It's the life we chose, guns and hoes
Guns and roses, niggas know that rock don't roll
Grab the spray, Drop the phone, Cop the O
Niggas know my flow is Mop 'N Glo
You know where I be on
I be on the styrofoam
Chicka-Chi 1, 2 like it was a microphone
Your girl's like a drive through, I want a combo
And she's so wet I need a towel, pronto

All this ice all over me, I should wear a thermos

Hit you with the burner, hit you with the burner

When I'm out of town and on the stage it's rest in peace
Murder, murder somebody call my lawyer
They said I was killing tennessee when I was down in florida
Murder, murder, my shoes none than a quarter
Rapping with the murder team nobody wanna record us
Murder, murder listen to the chorus

Put a whole in your head with no blame for it

Delaying, I'm stopping it
Put a end to your life, I'm blocking it

You know I know that white green like a chalk board

So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a zoo
Must be some owls in this bitch 'cause I keep hearin WHO
This for my niggas cookin 9s like they chicken breast
You know we tryna hide the 9s that's why the chickens dressed
I Had the lam Black and green like a parkeet
You know I ain't tripping
50 pigeons in a cherokee
Everything a nigga got is from slanging birds
What I ain't get from slangin blocks I got from slanging Birds... SNOW

New bitch new whip nigga change for what nigga change for
What and where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for sum
Drinkin' soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up

I'm popular and poppin' dough
Breakfast at Papa Deaux's
Dodgin all obstacles
Trappin at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still ridin' stop and go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though I'm hardin though
You should read the article
I'm ridin' high and dodgin hoes
You better hope I'm dodgin your model hoes
Dollar hoes, white lookin' Madonna hoes
Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo and the Prada hoes
College hoes on three, niggaz with a lot of dough
I Snoop guard the dough, I just love bein by the stove
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love bein right next to O's

I had a long day, my nerves bad
Yeah I'm smokin' on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewelery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands

We sittin' high speakin' like we super human Benz
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the doctor I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma sayin' I'm impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In Ziplocks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yeah "I got it bad"

I had a long day, my nerves bad
Yeah I'm smokin' on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewelery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands

(2 Chainz!) My plug need me, but he greedy
I ran off told me catch me on the TV
See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul
I'm yellin' fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I don't handcuff it
Sippin Grey Goose and we spendin mad ducats
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flaps, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a Funyon, or somethin'
I just left the trap house, money on money

I had a long day, my nerves bad
Yeah I'm smokin' on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewelery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands

When I woke up this morning
All I could think about was you
'Cause when I went to sleep last night
All I could think about was you
Adam and eve don't eat that fruit
'Best believe I'm a eat that boo
'Cause I'm the nigga that told them niggas
That told them niggas, 'bout you
Chuck the duce, while I'm ridin' through
Tityboi I might sign a boob
Your nigga hatin', tell your nigga that's hatin'
That if he gettin' some paper I might sign him too
'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through
I can see you niggas from a side view
I'm in and out the pussy, drive through
White coupe, with the white rims
I like to crack the top and let the light in
You know she dark skin her friend light skin
Put us together, and it's ice cream
Sandwiches she can't manage it
I know her man is sick, she can't handle it
She need some time alone I told her call my phone
And when she call my phone I did answer it

K.o
I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more
Roll till your bitches can't roll no more
K.o
I'm gonna pour it till you niggas can't pour no more
Blow till your bitches can't blow no more

B-i-g
Okay I'm in motion I'm rollin' and smoking
And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion
I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion
Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion
I'm burnin' bread toastin' and joking
'Cause I went from veiws
Of my moms house to views of the ocean
Niggas talk shit, but that's free promotion
I'm living my life like the end is approaching
Man fuck these niggas with a passion
I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket
My grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter
Till I bought her ass a house
Bigger than the pastor's, hallelujah
Your now fucking with a bad bitch connoisseur
My ex-girl said man the fame caught up to ya
Baby you don't still think about me, wet dream about me
I swear you use to couldn't wait to k.o

I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more
Roll till your bitches can't roll no more

I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one

(Verse 1: 2 Chainz)
Broken home, tell me what the fuck is wrong
Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles, pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill, X-file
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
Mama see the baby, this is karmasutra
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past, nevermind that
I don't know who's finer, you or this wine glass
And you must rewind that if you don't get it
Got a taste of the good life and tracks is what I'm eatin
My chromosomes read Georgia Dome
Icy watch, I don't mind spending time alone


(Verse 2: Jadakiss)
Yo, get the clip out of the ashtray, put it in the air
Grab my cellphone, call my engineer
Yea, last night I was on one
Quick carwash, then I make a mall run
I'm a different brother
Louie store spending chips on some kicks
I already got, different color
40 cally chrome, on deck
All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick
Always hustle to get it
I never ask for shit
If it's family or money I might have to flip
I'm a say it if it's on my mind
I like to take it one day at a time


(Verse 3: 2 Chainz)
Never on the guest list
Always unexpected
In so many checks
I should make a checklist
Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish
Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious
Left wrist, right wrist
Whip that, white bitch
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to right this
Look at my hue blow, watch how the light hit
Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit
I done did the dollars up, die nigga
Too dehydrated to cry nigga
I was struggling, had a time limit
I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said, "want it, if you hit it then you mine nigga"
Damn, that crazy bitch on that crazy shit
If you don't make money it don't make sense

I roll up an L in the lobby
My partner's got wops and it's probably a Glock or a Tommy
From H to the E double hockey sticks
Keep a chopper chop you if you try me bitch
Let's see who next on my homi' list
Carti like, "Rocky you bodied this", that's my prerogative
Shit on them, that's on my potty list
Accused of being boujee by a snobby bitch
Cops want to ID us, hope they as fast as my Adidas
She say I'm special, that's obvious
Rich 'cause my ideas run up the racks, for the most part
"I rap," when they ask what my hobby is
Run it up, not one of them
Rich as fuck, I'm a hundred up
Swipe, swipe, like I'm on a bus
It's A$AP and I ain't wanna rush

Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say
Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa

Sick bois don't die, they fresh to death
My shoes bright blue, so you watch my step
My hoody hot pink with the hat to match
So you ain't gotta know where my paper at
Pop tags 'cause I'm filthy, apes can bathe me
My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy
My hat tag up and it hang off slightly
My game 8-bit so you niggas can bite me
Nike like me cause my life is great
I'm married to the game, we should consummate
Brand new hoodies the color of light sabers
My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias
With fly ass sneakers
Bump them speakers
Pump this groove till your ear start bleedin'
White girls shake it till the black dudes notice
Black girls shake it so you can regain focus

Swag it out, swag it out

Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper
Born in SoCal, then I hit Atlanta
Then to New York, I'm an army brat
And I learn new things all across the map
In Cali I was small taught need to be strong
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks
So when they came around I had my first round pick
And now I'm so sick that they call me Ebola
Sick girls all on my pole like totem
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead
I can do it better even though I'm stone mountain
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York
So I got Southern Drawl and I limp when I walk
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap
No them fake fuck niggas askin' me for a track
Pokin' me on facebook tryin' to be my friend
Nigga you get your face took you ask me one more 'gain
I'm a genius, why they call the shit G-mail man
This is my space nigga, you can't make top ten
Explain

This that, fire!

It's your man Bambino, Sick Boi thriller
King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller
I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies
So if you don't know me by now: "You's a dummy"
It's the Sick Boi anthem, girls take your coats off
Get the champagne, pop the cork like Sosa
Make some mimosas, get like me
Spanish girls holla say, "Aye papi"
Ooh la la, on the French Riviera
These other boys sandals, straight club benders
We some go-getters, you should know better
Your girl think 'bout me while she drivin' a Jetta
Used to blast Kelly Clarkson, now she a sick girl
Hot pink shirt and them lime green sneakers
Take a quick picture, put me on blast
Call the fireman, he need to come fast
I'm on fire

They call me Sick Boi 'cause they know I'm so sick
Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks
Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick
And if you don't like my style: "Eat a dick"
I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so
I'm all puffed up like I'm made of afros
But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelery?
Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully
Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind
Now I look great, now I'm top of the line
Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes
Now I'm like "Mm... food" like MF Doom
Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris
Money in the bank, you can check my mattress
Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish
I got the game shook like a young black Elvis
Fire

I'm a diamond in the rough
Everybody knows the score
Bambino on top
And them haters claymore
"But the people want more!"
And I'mma give it to 'em
I was born a winner
All I had to do was show 'em
My hoodie canary yellow
But I'm bright on my own
Most haters out there take naps like combs
I never sleep, I'm always on my grind
I never eat, unless a rapper spit a rhyme
Sick girls jockin', haters keep hatin'
They pissed off 'cause I'm more eli than peyton
'Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under, dog
I'm not a nigga who mows snow like santa claus
I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls
'Cause I work from the bottom to the top
I used to be lost like lot
Haters got a shook core like pac, get it?

Said the proof is in the pudding
The secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
Said the proof is in the pudding
The secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss

I'm a winner (I'm a winner) (x8)

He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash (oh oh, oh oh)
Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin' picked last (oh oh)
Better think fast, there's a pop quiz (oh oh, oh oh)
On which nigga get popped before his 25th (ooh)
Y'all niggas need to learn to live, life is awesome
Open up your own store, get a house in boston
I know it's not easy, it takes some drive
Some niggas get desperate like the housewives
And they only see fortune, they don't see wealthy
You can lose a fortune, wealthy is healthy
You can't lose wealth, it's everywhere
The world's made of brewster's
There's millions here
But if you richard pryor, they having the cash you get
And hard work and hoping and your faith is set
I know the world's tough
I was just like you
I used to eat lay's, now my chips are blue...

I said the proof is in the pudding
The secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss
Say the proof is in the pudding
The secret's in the sauce
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss

I'm a winner (I'm a winner) (x8)

Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight?
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte
That I stay rock hard like a meteorite
But your homeboy here was an idiot right?
Well, ya thought wrong, I got flavor
I rock shows with the blue lightsaber
I hit dimes but also date eighters
I make moves, blow up like Al-Qaeda
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet
Ya kicks okay like your name Wyatt
Care Bear Clockers, pink highlighters
Haters wanna snack my heat like firefighters
Boys out there think they just like me
Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB?
Y'all standin' in line, I'm in VIP
Y'all know shit 'bout me like TIP, hah!

Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum

(Verse 2: MC Chris)
Think your voice's funny man, that's kind of hilarious
I'm the rapper makin' noise when there's shadow in your area
I'm like a ? 'cause I'm a little aquaceous
I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious
I'm high pitched, might flip if ya diss my node
Think Chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode
Weak ass sales, not too early to boast
Seriously bro, hand over the security code
Because my rhymes so fresh, green grocers' gotta spray 'em
Fired all my lawyers 'cause I didn't wanna pay 'em
From the PM to the AM I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off
Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana
MC without Glover is Matubb without Wigs
Jam and peanut butter with the crust cut off for kids
One smokes Khan, the other smokes Mids
Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
Smokin' in the alley cause you know we're playin' hooky
We're up to no good, please don't tell our mamas
? 'Cause we got this for Obama

Sick of the old yellow, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker thank Nutella
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a slick fella
'Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an Umbrella
Come over to my place, we can cut like shears
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm nasty? No. Forward? Yes
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess
My money so long that they call it John Silver's
Your money so light that it float like pillows
Oopsy, killers, you can see
They close up shop when the clerks see me
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped
Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not
This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade
You got the yellow face, that's my lemon aide
I'mma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard
Stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve

Girl on my dick, call me Cassinova
Real talk (?), my name is Oprah
My girl talk too but she deal in (?)
Got the gold top like I'm one of the Brady's
Birthday shit on the side, (get that quick) Mercedes

'Scuse me ladies! I know you wanna shoot me
Like my name's Jay Brady, but the camera's (?)
I wanna eat good Iike Rachel Ray
(Pop tags on) shoes (?)
My voice too high 'sposed to hold me back
They say the same fucking thing 'cause I'm young and black

Opposites attract
So not far from me is white dude with low voice and no money
Who gives a fuck if my voice sound funny
Fuck friends, I got me a bi-buddy
I'm true life Iike I'm MTV
Hollyhood like I'm six times three

(I been goin') so crisp, get dressed in a fly ass t-shirt
Nike so tight they make your fuckin' feet hurt
Jealous ass niggas when they see you rollin'
Same motherfucker on (?) scrotum
My sneaks so bright, and my girls so thick
Money so big call me Cici's dick

Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)
It's a (red alert), it's a
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)
It's a (red alert), it's a

I shine so bright they should call me sunlight
Call me punk rock cause my jeans is too tight
Diesel boo boo, (?) jacket
Got one e'ry week. It's a nasty habit
(?) And ups, that my standard
Show 'em who's boss like Tony Danza
Take it across state get the nasty plate
(?) Sex why I masturbate
It's the dude from the hood that you love to hate
'Cause I got new shoes and I love to skate
Me and Lupe got it kick push
To show these pussy ass niggas why we fuck they bush
I used to have to sweep floors just to make the ends meet
The ends meetin' like a motherfucker. Ain't that sweet?
Why I'm deep with the kids like Phish on myspace
Now I'm on your fish scales like I hang with Ghostface
They say black don't crack, except for Whitney
My shit don't crack, I fall off like Britney
To put it simply, I lose my balance
'Cause I got a pink drink and it makes me tipsy
Live the high life, make the full price
You want my advice to get the five mics
You wanna put them fake ass guns away
Nah, I'm just kiddin' nigga, you ain't got a chance anyway

(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
My name's Bambino, I'm always in trouble
I do stupid shit on a dare like double
Think your games tight, I'mma bust your bubble
I shop at Gucci and Barneys like rubble
Scope like Hubble, quick like chunnel
I leave MC's in the dark like tunnel
Men do huddles, girlfriends cuddle
Eh heh, all right

(Hook: Childish Gambino)
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoodie, my my my hoodie on glow

(Verse 2: Childish Gambino)
My hoodie so dope, my hoodie so tight
My hoodie in school cause my hoodie so bright
Welcome, my nigga, to color, Crayola
Got the bright purple, like a grape soda
Nigga I told you, my hoodie no joker
Walk up in the hoodie to a party like toga
Breathe like yoga, get off my scrotum
The color of my hoodie like a Lisa Frank folder
I'm at the Kid Robot, my wallet done shown up
They had five hoodies, but this shit done sold out
Spent too much, I know a bad habit
My hoodie look like a shit from a Trix rabbit

(Verse 3: Chaz Kangas)
Y'all know I'm a hoodie all pro
Find me in my hoodie like a hoodie Waldo
Rocking Amadeus like a hoodie falco
Staying self-absorbed like I'm Frida Kahlo
From the playground, with the sports team on it
To the old folks home, put some morphine on it
I rock my hoodie whether rain or shine
Over-priced in a Sam Goody frame of mind
Got a pouch in the front that holds my CDs
And warms my hands when it's too breezy
Believe me, the quickest way to get hurt
Is if I catch you calling it a hooded sweatshirt

(Hook x2: Chaz Kangas and Childish Gambino)

Go [x8]
Well wait a minute!
Go [x8]
Wait a minute!
Go [x4]
I'm so fresh~!
Go [x4]
Wait a minute! [echoes]

Childish Gambino:
Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram
I be the rich folk's hoe like a Ottoman
I got weed in my hand like a homey can
A throwback like a bitch throw Radaman
I'm fire! All I need is the breaks though
I make noise in the streets like a brake toe
But that's high, so I'm gettin' my fade low
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo
I'm livin' so shiny, ya boy on top
A life on trap, a nigga can't stop
I'm Weird like Al, I'm Strange like Love
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater
My hoodie light saber, like Darth Vader
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick
Need an "Entourage" quick so you can hug it out bitch

(Chorus: repeat with ad libs)
I'm so fresh! [oh yeah, oh oh]

Childish Gambino:
I'm so fresh like a "Sick Boi" oughta be
I'm not tryin' that shit, just a part of me
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggaz just Snoopy!
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney
I guess you can call me "The Perfect Storm"
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born
A nigga so tore call me Natalie
'Cause I love makin' music but they mad at me
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate
Out to be who I gotta be, that's the end of it!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Childish Gambino:
S-I-C-K B-O-I
You should come join us, nigga we so fly
Highlighter colors, brand new sneaks
Sick Bois stick together in a pinch like cheeks
We the new lost boys - I'm Peter Pan
'Cause I bring the bright green Tinkerbell in my hand
We can run "House Parties" - my name ain't Play
But youse a Kid, you should be on your way
Cut this like barkers, hoodies like Parkers
Haters on my dick, take a bite like sharkers
I'm a stay weirdo, I'm a straight hero
Haters want me stop makin' numbers like zero
I'm a get flyer, numbers get higher
You would stop movin, like a black tire
I'm not "The Wire" but I'm like Michael
Custom birdie green, they on dookie like fire

We the Sick Boi clique [x8]
Sick Boi till I die [x8]

Childish Gambino:
I'm sick like a hospital, whether you're in pain or not
I'm crazy like a swastika, inside of a bagel shop
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch~! Unstoppable
Think of me as hurricanes cause rappers are incomparable
Most of y'all insufferable, soundin like a bored scratch
Rappers are like ants to me, I stab 'em in the thorax
Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubador
Face it, only seen by a few like a unicorn
I'm a try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!
I'm a try to modify the subject like a predicate
I'm not the best rapper but I'm better than you
You with a big pickle like your name was Stu
I'm a Sick Boi, that's just how we do
Even your name's a game like you DJ Clue

Sick Boi till I die [x16]

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Girl show your wobble out
I'm not Queen Latifah but I set it off
I'm lookin' like a tight rainbow, Cangos
Got my blue rules
Lookin' like candy so I'm goodie two shoes
Call me Sproose Goose cause my clothes so fly
I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy
I'm a Big Mac, you just a small fry
Tryin' so hard to get that swagger like mine
I got them steps on my head I guess my mind wanders
Try to emulate my lifestyle like condoms
I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ
I keep a thick chick on the wire like Wee Bey
He say she say that I'm so handsome
And play keep away from his girl like ransom
Sorry that your girls all heroes like Sylar
You know I'm from the south, I stay dirty like Tyler

So sick wit it that they call me Ebola

My boom box handy, blastin' that stink
You can Marcus like Camby they call me the Tech
Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade
I ain't a lazy boy but I'm always gettin' laid
I'm jack of all trades I can do no wrong
I make a huge fart and it sound like a song
I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words
I shit out diamonds, you flossin my turds
I don't like ice... a little bit of gold and I'm nice
The Cool Kids understand my plight
I'm a simple Sam, I'm only sick wit it cause that's who I am
I keep that shit slick like my name was Pam
And even if I didn't
I'd be the flyest nigga drivin' around in a Civic
And for those who didn't get it you should play it back
I'm sick like a dog on crack, for realer

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Mapquest where the place is
Gats in they faces
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
Assassins replace expressions on faces
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
Hands full of aces, pockets on swole
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
Leave JFK's head just a big smoky hole
To console Jackie O she could smoke my pole
It's called Camelot 'cause she came a lot
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
And the game is still out there if you play or not
And I'm the King of Queens, Kevin James is not
I quit my temp job 'cause I can't let a day go
Tomorrow's moguls are delivering your bagels
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her kegels
'Cause when we take the game we won't leave you any Legos
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on
Horse head in your bed, now you know who you sleeping on
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
This booth is a crime scene
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
They only testified they know what hot shit this is

(Hook (x2): Childish Gambino)
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that'll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that'll make you stop

(Verse 2: Nick Packard)
Classic assassin
Straight from Central Castin'
I bust through your abode with both barrels blastin'
I crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in
I'm never gonna die like I'm Tuck Everlasting
Never thought that I'd carry an AK
All I ever wanted to be is Farley, Ferrell, or Fey
And maybe some day that dream will come true
But for now I got my gun and I'm aiming at you (Hey!)
In your house on your couch while you're readin'
I got no flow, it's more like breakthrough bleedin'
But I'm into cartoons and I'm really not sane
All I leave of your body is a Pinky and the Brain (Uh!)
I'm more Manson than a small-time crook
When it comes to taking lives I steal like Dane Cook
Bitch, take a look, you know it's in a book
Even LeVar Burton's Roots get shook

(Verse 3: Childish Gambino)
Ah, ah, you can call me assassin, I kill Versace
I walk too much, gotta Gucci watch me
The illest of the killers you can tell by my fashion
Light hoodie to bright sneaks it's all matchin'
I kill rappers, I don't need no stealin'
If I do lose a battle I'mma kill 'em for real
I'm just kidding, or am I?
Things get real in the City of L.I
That's right, I live in Queens
The borough of the lost
I hate the fuckin' yuppies but I love how much it costs
Call me in the winter and the spring to play tennis
And they give me strange looks 'cause I floss like a dentist
I'mma finish this sentence then get me a rope
So I got a little dough and I'm fresh like Scope
A nigga so dope, I got the new Pumas
That never take a bath so I call 'em homeschoolers
Numbers like rulers, I'm tired of it all
I sleep in the club and I yawn when I ball
I'm off the hook like phone calls
Where's kidrobot?
I need a new hoodie hot pink like doughnuts
The kids is Go-Gurts when they see my Gobstoppers
I'm not Mekhi Phifer, but I got Clockers
Transform a watch when I don't got diamonds
Boy, did you hear what I said like Simon?
I kill boutiques
Just snatch the new sneak
I'mma do it every week
I'm a serial killer
Beats like Dilla
Hun like 'tilla
It's the Sick Boi thrilla (Yeah, mon!)

(Hook (x2): Childish Gambino)

You're my babydoll
I'll hold you closer
I'll hold you closer
Just like I'm supposed to
Know I got what you need (x4)

I'm a weird dude, but you like me
Give other girls shocks like Nikes
I know I'm always on the road you can type me
And if you don't do that you can Skype me
I'm a big kid, and you know that
But it don't make me happy so we blow that
Can I make time? I don't really know
'Cause I see you're pissed off when I go to shows
I never really had a girl like this
But I ain't never had a girl who could keep interest
The things that I do, the things that I wanna be
I know I'm hardheaded, can't see things in front of me
I'm gonna be the best, you can believe that
So try an understand when I have to leave that
When I'm done, I'ma give you the call
Don't ya know sugar, you my sugar babydoll

I love you both, can't you tell?
I love her lights, I love the smell
But I think you kinda know I got a girl on the side
She pay for my house and she pay for my ride
She give me nice things and she make me feel good
She give me a little cash and I spend on you
She my sugar mama only with her for the money
But you know it's untrue 'cause I talk about her funny
Saturday night's, I'm supposed to be with you
But instead I'm in bed with the stage and the crew
She laughs at my jokes, she tells me I'm cute
She tells me if we together we make a little loot
But I know I couldn't have her if I didn't have you
And I know sometimes I don't make curfew
Ya know I'd never, ever, ever try to hurt you
I'm a just try to do what I gotta do

I ain't your ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya

Gam-B, the one like Neo
You didn't see it coming
Reverse Miss Cleo
I'm C-P30
Or better yet Anakin
When it comes to lightsaber's that I'm handlin
I used to be king of the whack look
Now I stay king of the mac book
Yes mac book, where you write your numbers down
Yeah boy, I got girls in and out of town
You got it wrong like saying OJ;IJ
Stop the rumors
Asian girls don't got sideways
I gotta fuck every shade of latte
I gotta flow like my mouth to Kanye's
These niggas think that I'm playing, I ain't saying nothing
I'll fuck your girl on the burner
I'm so top stuffing
You can't stop nothing, I'm the juggernaut
That's why your B's sweet on me like I'm butterscotch
Yeah we run a lot
Boy the track runners here
I'm Elroy we jet sun out the atmosphere
Let me make it clear
I'm your inner fear
And I'm taking over, please don't interfere

Uh I'm the streets desire
Your getting too old man, please retire
Don't make me carry you like I'm liar liar
Bring the heat like a monster, I'm Elmo's fire
I'm too busy spittin' shit with a socialite
I'm too busy sittin' bitch with some model types
Yes sir my girl's look like Rihanna twice
With some packed bags, yeah, they ain't going home tonight
Get your camera phone, prove ya seen me
Or else you'll be with friends like "Please believe me!"
I'm all that, I'm Kel and Kenan
Nigga, I come hard like I'm filled with semen
These rappers bore me
Gun talk with black clothes
Y'all let me know when y'all let 1998 go
Y'all niggas scared to grow
I'm never scared to go
Anywhere that's new, I go outside, y'all niggas stay at home
But that's all right dude
I'm a special guy
Y'all been wanting to rap since you were ankle high
And I've been wanting to rap since like what, 05?
Do the math man, how are you one of the best alive?
Gam-B, yes me, best out there
Trying to get universal like healthcare
So fresh, so clean, like a new pair
When you get to the top what you do there?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm cooler than an ice cube, yeah I'm rude
'Bout to get your head sliced, yeah I'm nice
And you 'bout to pay the price
Like The Price Is Right, but I'm not Bob Parker
Yes, I get down like I'm Charlie Parker
Meaning that I'm musically inclined
If you try to get with mine I'm about to blow yo head back
Get another bullet and I spray bullet (bullet)
And I spray back, pop, pop, click, click (drop, drop) down
Now they lookin' for your body like all over the town
Niggas, my name Gambini, I used to be clean
Now I'm dirty martini, 'cause this boy met world like Feeny
These niggas make wishes like genie

Nigga you know how we do
Latinos, black people, and gringos
This money stained my fingers like Cheetos
Blast it out your speakers like keedoh
'Cause I can barely hold it all in like Speedos
These niggas got a lot of nerve
These niggas got a lot of speaks
And all these skinny bitches busy shop at Anthropologie
Who you tryin' to be?
I'mma take my girls to BIM and treat 'em like a VIP
Because I am a G, ugh (G, ugh)
I start the party like Chex Mix
Put it in your house like Netflix
Beat, nigga, it's what's for breakfast
Y'all niggas got beef with this kid
Y'all niggas' punks and stay punks like the Misfits
I'm way off in the distance
Y'all done lost the race like McCain
But like McCain, you used to be cool but now you lame
It's hard to maintain ain't it?
Because I am so much better (than before)

My swag is so sick, you might catch it
I'm tired of fuckin' 'round with little kids like I'm Brad Pitt
These little kids need to play in traffic
'Cause all they was was make a nigga giggle like mad-libs
I'm hot like an attic in the summer
And girls scream "Sick Boi" like we know each other
But we don't know each other, you ain't my fucking brother
We need to separate like organic peanut butter
My lightsaber flashing, my kneecaps ashyExplain
And girls of the world used to walk right past me
Now I hang with girls like my girl Kate Perry
I might have to marry Kate like my name Ashley
These rappers don't know what they up against
They can't see a nigga like my names Snuffleupagus
If you don't like my shit, why the fuck you bumpin' this?
I am so much better (than before)
You better get it clean good 'cause this the last straw
And break inside house and leave your gas on
Nigga, we NASA, 'cause we 'bout to blast off
Go in the bathroom, we see you peein' like I'm Shasta McNasty
Get it? UPN? Shasta McNasty?
Nigga, I'm a master
And I'm fucking plastered
I don't need a fucking beat for this, I can make my shit up
While I go here's the part that I'm about to show ya

I'm the best 'cause I gotta
The devils wears Prada
And he's got a boom boom like Welcome Back, Kotter
Leave your guy like my daughter
Got cheese like frittata, greed, and filata
Got ya, mama
Most rappers want the drama, but I don't want the drama
I just want a quiet night down at Benihana
I rap 'cause I gotta
Dude's got nada
I make 'em all proud like my middle name Obama

One, two, three, check it out

On the road to sandwiches and chicken wings
Phat people do phat things
Using salt and pepper for their seasonings
Phat people do phat things
Check it out

It's B to the I to the double L-Y
My friends all know I'm not an ordinary guy
I like little things, like chicken wings
BBQ sauce, honey mustard, onion rings

And when my cell phone rings it goes jingle-jing
I say hello, I say hello, I say who this be?
They say it's Fancy Ned, I got a fancy head
I'll eat a fancy ass sandwich on some fancy ass bread

(Verse 2: Childish Gambino)
The wait is over, shut up, bend over
I hang with bar stools, I chill with Grover
The boy Ebola, my boy phat too
And my girl so phat that they call her Oprah

I got that green like a bowl of okra
Loose change so phat can't fit my sofa
I head to the bank, call the shit my grocer
It's Sex in the City, get the phat mimosa

Me and B, we phat boys, hang with phat girls
Driving phat toys, fuck Dan Aykroyd
I'm live on a Saturday night
I got two phat girls, I'm doing it right

Like my name John GoodmanExplain
I got the phat crib so I'm doing real good, man
And I'm up to no good, man
This is how I get phat, call the shit cooking

Phat people do phat things

(Verse 3: Billy Scafuri)
I tip waitresses, I tip scales
My style is kind of phat like an Orca whale
I'm sipping whole milk as I stare
Thinking I can be your Oprah, you can be my Gail

'Cause I am a phat boy, never been to Bally's
Married to this phat life, call me Kirstie Alley
Married to the snack life, counting every calorie
Might just open up a phat boy art gallery

(Verse 4: Childish Gambino and Billy Scafuri)
What else you do, B?
I'll make it easy
What else you do, B?
For girls to squeeze me

I'm phat but my numbers run
Listen son, I'mma show them how it's done
When my swagger weighs a ton
Stickin' straws inside of girls, you can call me the Capri Sun

(Verse 5: Childish Gambino)
I make the girls drip, so I guess I eat Gushers
Screaming out yeah like I'm eating out Usher
In your dad's bedroom where I fuck you
Knockin' on the door, so you're screaming out "nothing"
But they all know it's something
You didn't think I'd tear the pussy up, did you pumpkin?
But better and better like Benjamin Button

(Verse 6: Billy Scafuri)
I hang out with Chester Cheeto
Cooler than the ranch on your Dorito
Hotter than the peppers in your burrito
Getting cheddar and cream, if you know what I mean

(Verse 7: Childish Gambino)
Yeah, I know what you mean, home girl mistaken
She think Gambino won't bring home bacon
Or bring home Swiss cheese, my dough got holes
Cause all these hoes want shoes and nice clothes

They want the Macy's, the Neiman Marcus
The Fendi purses, the Gucci parkas
I know you want it, don't get me started
They see Gambino and they act retarded

Phat people do phat things

Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks, mother fucker, eat snacks
Eat snacks coming out of packs
Guaranteed to put a little fat on your back
Eat snacks

You think you know me
But you can blow me cause you don't know how I feel

(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
It's Childish Gambino, ho
What you know about that?
Niggas 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats
'Cause if they see me, they might have to act right
I'm livin' life right, like I got a past life
Boy I got a flashlight
Check my fuckin' hoodie skin
Like God was makin' light and threw my hoodie in
Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym
Call me Elroy
Nigga we some hooligans
And just in case, I keep a million in the glove box
Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock
Ice cold, bright colors, like a juice pop
And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop
Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin' showin' up
Boy it's me, T.N.T., boy I'm blowin' up
Nigga throw it up
Boy, I am the awesome

Or Mr. "Hey, how much it cost him?"

(Hook: MC Chris)

(Verse 2: MC Chris)
Okay!
Rackin' 'em, stackin' 'em, packin' these ballers
Readin' these, beatin' these hoes like Carver
Whittle like cardboard, steady like barbers
I'm back and forth from the front to the starboard
Back up Marlin, it's only a suit
Like high torch 'cause he ain't get the boot
Like fly gossip, birds in the zoo
Cause the underground sound I'm reiteratin through
Once I'm in the mad loop, what a real man do
With a cannibalistic crew, when they runnin' on the loose
Can't handle the truth, like a fart to a scoop
Put my hand on the mic and my mind on the loot
Crime to duke, ridin' away
I'm a dick snub that you bothered to say
I get krunk then the car pull away
Now don't get sick got the shit on spray, okay?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Yes, I'm Mr. Big Stuff
Yeah, my stuff big, man
Keep a girl's pussy bright red like a pig's tan
Four shots and watch me lean like a kick stand
I really need to change my name to, "Hey, I'm a big fan."
Cause that's all I hear when I'm outside
And my hoodie's never jealous of that tie-dye
Cheesy on the mic, like I'm laying on Jordan
No homo for you niggas homophobic

Yes, I back bend these girls aerobic
And these hoes got a Spiderman like Tobey
Keep these girls wet, call them Lakers like Kobe
Got money trees, asking me, "Do you row me?"

Latin girls kiss my feet like they're superguh
Latin girls see your face and call you "Stupida."
Yes my name is Childish, so I guess I'm cheesy
Yes yes yes my wallet's cheesy
Throw your hood up, are you queasy?

Yes, I am the Juggernaut
Yes, my name is Elroy
Yes, my dick will make that ho tell, like a bell boy
And I get my tip, and my tip is in your girl
And I'm gonna bust a nut like I'm a Gallagher squirrel

It's the man of the hour
Better yet, the century, check the whiskey sour
Lookin' like I'm drinkin' piss
How's he fuckin' thinkin' this
Easy, I'm a mentalist, but I'm not on CBS

Uh, yes it's me Bambe
What is your daughter to do?
I've been doing this ever since Harry Potter was new
Boy! I don't play, I change games, I am too real
So my words stay hard like a blue pillExplain

I like pink, it always looks good on me
And I like pink, it always looks good on me
That second part I was talking about vagina, homie
Fuck the game at an early age, now there hymen on me

Yes, I am a magnet
Yes, I do attract it
Remember when these fake ass niggas called me faggot?
'Cause I had glasses and a pink track jacket
Now those things are assets to help me get some asses
Now these nerdy hoes keep asking me to smash it
Bullies from middle school chatting on my Twitter status
Fuck you, you don't get shit from now on
Unless you got a demo tape, then I can lay some brown on

It's the B to the AMBI, colors like candy
Nigga, I'm the Army. I'm being all I can be
Yes I dress dandy. Get a clue, like the Clandy
I live hard, I never sleep in, like an Amby

This is for the niggas thinkin' different
While their friends are flippin' pigeons in they're stay po-pimpin'

He never lets the best go past him
My life says yes like it's having orgasms

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Girl, I messed up real bad
I'm looking back on the days that we both had
I go to bed and I dream so hard
Of little mixed kids running in the front yard
I need you close, I need your kiss
I never ever, ever, ever knew a love like this
I, miss you more than puffy missed b.i.g
I didn't think that you would leave a hole this big
In my life, you need to be my wife
I made this song, I hold my pillow tight
And wishin' it was you, what can a nigga do
Fuck this success, fuck these interviews
Fuck these phone calls, girl you are worth it
When I was happy, you were happy, you are perfect
When I was blue, you were blue, you're my smurfette
I put my best chips on the worst bet

Girl, I need you like I need air
And fuck those other honeys, I will be there
I never ever, ever thought that I would be scared
Of living in a world when you're not there
My biggest fear is that you won't give a fuck
When you play this song on your macbook
"Is that cg, yo, he is old news
I'm way too busy with my new dude."
The best time I ever had
Is kissing in my shitty ass kia van
I wish that it was me instead
Feeling all your pain
I know that it is different now
It will never be the same but
I swear to god, our love special
You can be my number 2 like one pencil
Or you can be my number one, I will let you
In on my life, I've changed so much since you
Left, that hotel room
And if you're with another guy, go tell dude
That he can never keep us apart, he needs a better door
He'll always be the guy that you settle for
I'll always be the guy you're s'posed to be with
Where the fuck is cupid when you need him
I'm so sam cooke, I need tea for two
I play sam cooke and I think of you

Baby girl we need to be together
This song ain't for my album
This song is for the better
And even though we living in a city full of strangers
They can see I'm different
They can see my anger
They can see my pain
They can see the way I talk about you
They see the way I living and I won't live long without you
I drink every night, I smoke more too
I guess it's safe to say death or you
I need you more now than I ever did
I'm still the same guy you fell in love with
I need a second chance like I need a prayer
Sometimes I think god just doesn't care
I hope he has a plan for both you and i
So we can be together at a different time
Remember when I come home late
And you'd be crying over some food on a cold plate
I'll never do that shit to you again
You're the most beautiful girl I ever known and my best friend
Baby girl we need to make up
And when I dream of you, I don't want to wake up
And when I don't dream, I don't want to wake up
I'd rather die now than not have your touch
'Cause I miss you so much

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I got skinny jeans on, so I got my swagger
I got new kicks and embarrass my?
A skinny tattoo with a paintball space
So a nigga got bounce like a pinball game
I got housewives like my name was bravo
The dude is bueller, the world chicago
I'm hard to follow, ya boy's sick
I'm adam sandler so fuck ya clique
I hang with dogs like michael vick
And ya girls get wet like a glass of quick
Cause your boy stay fresh like a bunch of mints
And I fight this flow like a pacifist
A barrel of monkeys, a house of chimps
I'm way more fun than your boyfriend is
He need new jeans like a accident
Cause your boy right here where the action is, ah!

Don't talk about it
You can live without it
You don't even need to go down?
Don't talk about it
You can live without it
You don't even need to go down?
Cause you were hollerin', hollerin' "oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "oh!" girl
Cause you were hollerin', hollerin' "oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "oh!"
Hollerin', hollerin' "oh!" girl

I said these niggas mad at me like baby boppers
These niggas slept on me like old pajamas
You niggas stay soft like jon secada
And this nigga stay lit like a candelabra
And even if I didn't have a million dollars
I would still have cream like beard papa
Girl I ain't playin' I'll treat ya proper
I got no limits like silkk the shocker
You look too sweet like betty crocker
You could ride in the front, you could meet my partner
My boy in the back, you could meet my partner
But he ain't got a girl so you should bring your partner
Ya boy got books like he made of lockers
The girl got legs like a pair of dockers
Tito chip like empinadas
You should shake that shit till you got maracas

(Break)
If we're together
Can do whatever
I'll make sure that you're close to me
Cause baby girl it's a fantasy
As long as you are here with me tonight

'Cause I want ya
'Cause I need ya girl
'Cause I want ya
'Cause I need ya girl, yeah

(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
People say I'm crazy, I'm loony, I'm psycho
I like it
I got my shit checked like Nike
Doctor said he'd never seen anything like me
Chances of recovery are nil to not likely
Boy so crazy make your baby mama look sane
Kicking thoughts around like he got a loose brain
I got a whiskey, sour, sober
Until I fall down like it's mid October
Young young Hova
Boy I say, for goodness sake
I'm in my prime like I'm standing on my dinner plate
You niggas innerspace cause you come up Martin Short
I'm so fly I don't need a right wing from Drudge ReportExplain

(Hook x2: Childish Gambino)
Ah! Stay wildin' like me!
My name Bam-B!

(Verse 2: G.E.T.H.)
People say I'm angry
But if you're happy, you're crazy
I'm violent, so I've got a blue belt from Renzo Gracie
Read the news today, oh boy, some kids are dead
Pulled the covers over my head and went straight back to bed
Cause even my good days are generally bad
At my happiest, I'm just slightly less sad
And I get mad if you're glad to be alive
'Cause I had a chance at a happy life
Good mom, good dad
Seriously trust me, you wouldn't wanna be me
The best days of my life involve leftovers and TV
I got almost no friends and I don't know how to handle this
Even the friends I do got are all moving to Los Angeles
Even I'm tired of my whining
Even I don't want no more of me
I whine more than a 3-year old multiplied by Morrisey
Every time I meet someone who wants to be my friend
The first thought that I have is, "Yo what the fuck is wrong with them?"
I go through life with my fists up
But trust me my fists are all
Full of handfuls of Wellbutrin and Risperdal
I'm depressed y'all
Someone please help me (Please help me)
Seriously (Seriously right now)
Help

(Verse 3: Childish Gambino)
I'm good with the N
No not the Nina
Mean I'm good with the hammer so I'll fix your broke heater
And not your bro Keeter
I don't tote guns
I never had white so I never needed one
And the hood respect me, I rose from the ashes
They call me the phoenix in the clear rim glasses
They saw me work with all that work
Now I got my own enterprise, call me Kirk
And I'm born on an air force base, so I'm fly
Move out to Decatur, that's Atlanta's Bed-Stuy
I got that pink like pussy
Got that pussy day and night so they call me Kid Cudi
Bitch!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Uh, they call me the rocker
Uh, yeah, uh-huh, uh

They call me the rocker
I get down like 2Pac and Big Poppa
Some say he too birds, you can't stop him
Niggas got too much beef like two Whoppers
Look at my clockers, it's about time
For a nigga to mature like a glass of fine wine
Ain't no nigga alive can outshine
I get sneaks, but don't pay like I'm crime
I run this bitch, 'cause I'm Will Smith
'Cause I am legend and you just Hitch
Naw, I'm Hitch
'Cause I get bitchesExplain
Well, I got more than one so call me eight Hitches
We ain't got riches, just some nice kicks
So call me Bruce Lee who's dressed in nice shit
Haters think I'm lame and girls think I'm sick
But both of them groups is riding my dick

Yeah, they call me the rocker
Call me Mr. Gambino

Uh-huh, check this out
I'm fly like birds and I spit real shit so my flow like turds
And my words absurd so I turn it all around
So my mouth is my ass and I sit when I'm loud
And I'm black and I'm proud
And I'm white and I'm rich
So fuck it, I'm a martian, I'm Lilo and Stitch
Niggas say I sound like Weezy and shit
Well he the best in the game so what's wrong with that?
Are you trying to tell me that my rhymes is phat?
Call me Usain Bolt 'cause I run the track
Nigga I'm sick of that
Stop comparing me to people
I know my voice funny like my name John Heder
And I'm out of this world and I'm hot like space heaters
And my girl top down so I call her two seater
My iPhone blast like TNT
I text back to home girl, "What you know 'bout me?"
I'm in NYC or in ATL
And my wallet stay fat like Kenan plus Kel
Nigga what's that smell, cause my shit don't stink
Cause my shirt bright blue and my shoes hot pink
And I finish this drink that I call a Twin Tower
Two Bud Lights and a whiskey sour
Where I fall down, that shit is ground zero
Little kids saying, "There goes my hero!"

Hahahaha
They call me the rocker, nigga!
Uh, they call me the rocker
Yo I'm out man

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Intro : Childish Gambino)
It's Childish Gambino, y'all know who it is, how it is and what it do
Mr. Jens Lekman on the track, ladies and gentlemen
For those of you wondering for whom the sample is
All right. Let's do this. Uh-huh

(Verse 1: Childish Gambino)
I'm the sickest Nigga ever, go and tell your ma!
And I got a little liquor like a St. Bernard!
Niggas hold onto Cliffs, like Phylicia Rashad!
'Cause I'm always on the edge, but I don't fall off!
I's a boy in the hoodie and a hat to match!
And the shit bright orange like a pumpkin patch!
And they call me Guy Ritchie 'cause I work with snatch!
And I'm rich, and a guy. Whatch'all think of that?
And the cops stay on me 'cause I'm young and black!
And the boy stay crazy like a pound of crack!
And I'm all that jazz like my name was scat!
College dudes like me too love my name Borat!
And I like my girls thick like chocolate, fat like my wallet
I'm tellin' y'all the truth, like a prophet
And if Gambino on the track, you should copy it
And all y'all Niggas totin' guns need to stop it

I'm so focused. Yeah
I'm so focused. Yeah. (We don't play around like that. Listen.)
We ain't scared a you! Tell them other muthafucka we prepared for you! Ungh!
We ain't scared a you! Tell them other mutha f- we prepared for you! Ungh!

(Verse 2: Truff Syrum)
Before you even know how long this song lasts
You'll be reelin' and feelin' so flabbergasted
Like a fast pass that you can't catch, I'll leave you blasted
Lambasted, like I doused you in acid
I could be takin' some comedy and I'm makin' that tradic
Like I spin, 'cause I hocus, I focus, I'm flippin' it back and now it's magic
And the beat go from cool, like plan is to janet, to dammit!
Cuties cute in to inspect my go-go gadget
Why? 'Cause I spit in split time. It's a sign of a double wear prada I'm reachin'
I'm teachin' 'em for a while that you can't deny I'm alive
So existential, my rhymes are quintessential
I'm an educated black and that's a fact. I'm presidential
One riff, and I'm siftin' through N-s lies
Got a gift to keep my eyes on the prize, you best move to the side
'Cause I'm goin' for the gold, I'm a stone solider
Gambino told you Jokers that I'm so, so, so foc- I'm so FO-cusssssssed

(Verse 3: Childish Gambino)
I'm all grown up, but I'm still Childish
It's crazy to think that all them days is behind us
I remember when n-s tried to stop us
Now them same n-s on my dick and try for profit
This is what I asked for. It comes with the territory
This isn't a cry for help, ain't no pinnochio story
I'm in it just for the glory - I'm in this to win it, babe
Sorry that I came home late

(Hook: Amber Petty)

Starlight
Where did you go?
I've been running around the world
Gotta let you know

(Verse 1: DC Pierson)
I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
When it hits your eye like a get in your eye thing
And we do the I like you like like you like like thing
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear y'all converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke, I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's 'cause I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
Nights on the pavement, you just stop breathin'
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard
They call me Violet Beauregard, 'cause I just blow up, no regard
All I really need is a bar to belly up to
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to
So what are you up to? This weekend I'm free
Till then I'll just shine and let you find meExplain

(Verse 2: Childish Gambino)
I shine like the sun
My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run, two things like a pun
This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue
My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country
I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line
I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli
I make these niggas say 'Great' like Tony
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby
The wait is over, no baking soda
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders
I saw them dudes move flats and corners
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover
I got that green like a four leaf clover
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters
Dope boys they get me, we got the same hustle till the tank on empty
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire
And get the shit straight, turn back, retire
'Cause one in a mil turn snow to fire
You either move weight, play ball or neither
Because I'm neither, the hood Macgyver
The boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda
My life so sweet that my balls Godiva
The world in front and the hood behind us
The hood behind us
Yeah
The hood behind us

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Baby I'm living the dream
With you by my side we work as a team
I know I'm a mac, it's not what it seems
I'm covered in pink, from swimming in green
When I'm eating you like Edy and me
Mama the stars could not intervene
You are a star, I'm keeping it clean
You are the prettiest girl I have seen
What does that mean? It means you're the one
And most of these dudes are just fucking for fun
Girl you know that I would never do that to you
All of the girls that I do must be beautiful
Inside and out, meaning your mouth
Girl I'm just playin', this is what I'm sayin'
If you like real, then give me a go
If you never try, then you'll never know

Ooh it's all right, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
'Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
And if the sun don't come out
Ooh it's okayExplain
Let them all know that I got this way
'Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
Never, ever, ever let me go
Do you love me? Girl I need to know
'Cause you're my sunshine girl
'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
Baby girl, you're always on my mind
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine
'Cause you're my sunshine girl
'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh

Look, I'm the man to know
I'm the one to give you more
Ma, you got that stupid flow
I talk about moms like Margaret Cho
And I'mma go, minus the "o"
So I'm a g, sportin' a V-
Neck and a check, on my shoes
'Cause I got nothin' to lose, uh
I'm in it to win it
Money so long I get business from Guinness
Diving in green, I'm swimming in spinach
And I'm in the race, who cares about finish?
I got an advantage, and I'm an advantage
I'm ?, you need an advantage
And nothing is heinous so I can work for ya
Couldn't stand out, girl

Ooh it's all right, ooh it's okay
Let them all know that I got this way
'Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
And when the sun don't come out
Ooh it's okay
Let them know I got this way
'Cause I miss you girl
I wanna be with you, yeah
Never, ever, ever let me go
Do you love me? Girl I need to know
'Cause you're my sunshine girl
'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh
Baby girl, you're always on my mind
Baby girl, it's time to make you mine
'Cause you're my sunshine girl
'Cause you're my sunshine, sunshine, oh

I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Stompin' on these niggas like a whack-a-mole with no hands
Get girls on the floor like slow jams
Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion
My light shine bright, no roaches
Nigga, I'm focused
You the one who eyes wrong
Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone
'Cause I'm so fly, homes
Fresh like pinecones
Female phone book my iPhone
Margarita bright, meanin' limelight
Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night
Mouth like a pussy, it can never be too tight
Let me guess, you know a better rapper, you, right?

Bam-B
Sicker than your grandma
Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler
This track is gettin' over written
Sports night, Fanta
Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta
I am at the top
Whether you want or not
And I am in my prime
I am an autobot
I do not talk a lot
I am just a rapper
Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper

Sick

Yeah, I stay fly like a pelican
Get new kicks everyday like an ottoman
Ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again
I try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them
Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me
Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese
Band of outsiders
Kitsune, APC
Macy's got shit on me

Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock
I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop
Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir
You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour
Niggas jealous 'cause I got more green than seven splinters
I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigra
Young, smart, and handsome
Who could even ask for more?
I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore

I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7)
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Sick

I'm the prince, put your crown on the ground (x7)
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh
Sick

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I do not, I do not, I am just, I am just a rapper

Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet bein' empty
'Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain

And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening

I'mma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzy Bear, what the fuck
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping 'cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would

Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, 'cause I'm no better now
'Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!

I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen.

I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate church and state.

I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (be a rapper).

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(DC Pierson)
Whoa
What'd you get, amnesia?
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or somethin'
And my bank balance were around a grand or somethin'
Ask you somethin':
Do you think I'm common like sense it?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend

Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the tin man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the mean time don't come crying for the thin man
In the mean time I'll be building my portfolio
All these other dudes eradicated like polio
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks
I bet you wanna fuck me when it's time to star buck

(Childish Gambino)
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone
Now I'm all gassed up like Exon
Girls see the money like I fuckin' got checks on
I dunno even know if this girl really likes me
Pickin' up the check like I'm workin' at Nike
Talkin' to this girl and I'm thinkin' that she's into me
Then I find out she's tryin' to break in the industry
That's really lame
I still hit it
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
I'm lookin' for a sick girl to be a part of me
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me

Yes, homie I'm a man of my word
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd
And, yes, these gold diggers tryin' to get at my sperm
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
I know my girl out there somewhere
And if you hear this, you should come here
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

In the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith
Sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice
But they don't like me
Because I'm too nice
And I'm kinda fat
And not the dope type

But I grew out of that
And it's a miracle
Not every girl sees me as marrying material
It's a buyers market
I'm Alicia's target
And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet

I love these hipster girls
And they feel the same
Now they don't have to choose when someone asks them Drake or Wayne
And niggas waiting on me
We didn't have a voice
We used to have to act street but now you've got a choice

My momma's brownie mix
I keep the goodies moist
Of every girl I'm tappin
This wasn't supposed to happen
Hard to keep my thoughts straight
On every date
Especially when my penis talking
SWAT team, cover me
I'm going in.

I do not talk. I am just a rapper.

Yes, I got
I'm meeting other girls
But you don't wanna hear that
For fear that I fuck a lot.
And you don't wanna get attached 'cause you'll like me
I fucked a girl named Keira Knightly
Nah, I made it up
Cause it sounded dope
I don't give a fuck.

Ride me, Giddy up.

They can hear us in the hall, arsenio.
Naw girl I don't wanna shoot a video
I do it all day
Don't you watch me on the TV show?
I'm gonna get mines any means necessary
Got red bull pulsing through my pulmonary
Least I feel like it

Met her at a club
Now we're making out
And I ain't spend a dub
I'm gonna try to live it up like top floor
And my girls like get so I bought more

All girls 18 and over love this light speed Casanova
House pimped out will young sonoma
Sleep on me that is a coma

Yeah nigga, you see what I'm getting at
I'm getting at her
I'm hitting that
Her kitty cat purred
How weird is that?
I'm digging that

A nigga not
Trying to say I don't make mistakes
I'm trying to fix all the hearts I break
But every time that we talk in my apartment
We're gonna kiss a little
And then we start shit

You're heartless!
Don't call again!
Don't email!
We can't be friends!
I swear that this is the end!
Then I call her next week
And we do it again.

My girls, my girls, my girls. my girls.
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls.

I don't mean to seem like I care about material things, like a social status.
I just want four walls and adobe slabs for my girls.
Ow!

Sick. Uh.

Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

I do not talk.

I do not talk. I am just a rapper.

Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming cheeto
I'm tighter than baby speedos
I'm shifting another kilo
And that's because my shits dope
Walking past the red rope
The bouncer is my kin folk
So I don't need credentials

Sick boy is my clique
I got that shit inside a headlock
Love to make that bam bam
We were born to make the bed rock

I am so hip hop
More so than you guys
I am legend
You guys are true lies

Tipsy like some jenga
Shout out to my topangas
Them fifty fit girls stay wrapped around my finga
Nerdy girls from every where
They scope me out like there he is
My whole crew's sick
I'm hanging out with jerry's kids

Hold up mother fucker
It's gambini on the microphone
Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on
Girls addicted to my dick
My wallet is there methadone
Brain dead niggas love beef
They are vegetables

I am on that fly shit
Fuck that, I'm orbiting
My face is everywhere
Fuck that, I'm norbiting

I can feel your heat, momma
I can hear your feet, momma

...Give you the sunrise
I wanna give you the sunrise
I wanna give you the sunrise
I wanna give you the sunrise

You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too

You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this

You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this

Been on another level
Since you came
No more pain
You look into my eyes
You can't recognize my face
You're in my world now
You can stay
You can stay
But you belong to me
You belong to me

If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go

Siouxsie Sioux and the Weeknd:
This is a happy house (A happy house)
We're happy here (We're happy here)

The Weeknd:
Music got you lost
Nights ends so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But baby it's okay, they my niggas next door
They be working in the trap, so get louder if you want
Just don't blame it on me girl
That you didn't call your home
Just don't blame it on me girl
'Cause you wanted to have fun

If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go

The Weeknd:
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the seven

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then, watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
Ain't no offense though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street

La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out

Whip the 707 out
Whip the 707 out

I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at

Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards to her
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here

Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma I'll give you all I got
Get me off on this
I need confidence in myself
Listen ma I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it

So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for one night
Even though you don't love me

Just tell me you love me

Even though you don't love me

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the devil

Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby
So put down your perfume

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here

Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking word too

I understand your body wants it
I know your thoughts
Oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl and it's your world
And I'ma let you do it how you wanna
Girl alright baby, right baby
I know you know I know you wanna... with it
Don't be shy pretty, I'll supply pretty
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

With your Louis V bag
Tatts on your arms
High-heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the party
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the party
On your knees
I will not beg you please

Girl, pick up them shoes
I'll race your ass up on them stairs
Just grab a room I swear no one will interfere
Girl bring your friends if you want, we can share
Or we could keep it simple, baby
We can just ride baby, ride baby
I know you know I know you wanna... with it
Don't be shy baby, I'll supply baby
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

With your Louis V bag
Tatts on your arms
High-heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the party
To pluck the feathers of all the birds
You always come to the party
On your knees
I will not beg you please
I will not...

Ride with it, ride with it
I know, you know, I know you wanna line with it
Don't be shy pretty, I'll supply pretty
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

Won't you lie with it, lie with it
I know you know I know you wanna...
I got you girl, oh I got you girl

Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
I think I'm fucking gone
Rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four
My sessions are the strong on your floor
Shouldn't have fucking rolled
But I fucking rolled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walk through the store
When I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it but I made it that's for sure
For sure, loving I need more, I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it though, sippin' on this
Baby livin' off bliss got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme my attention or I'll start drowning from my wrist

Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you
Oh you
You, oh you
'Cause I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me

I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops then I might get violent
No calls worth stopping
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling I'ma give to you
Oh you, you
Oh you, Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me

Oh I got it girl

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I got somethin' to tell you
But don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I can only say one thing:
Girl, I been bad again
Girl, I been bad again

'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use 'em but I'm fading
I forget
I forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

Pick
Up
Your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm
All alone
I'm feeling everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
(x2)

Poppin' again
I tried to quit again
I'm always tight wit' somethin' I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
So play what I take, I take what I spend baby
I ain't lyin' to nobody but me
And you
And me
But you especially

Pick
Up
Your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

They say my brain meltin', and the only thing I'll tell 'em
Is I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So baby take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fucking seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys then I play all day (all day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (all day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day (all day)
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're going
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rolling through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fucking twenty, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doing in the bathroom?
I hear noises in the bathroom
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have twenty different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, motherfucker, I'm raw
My love so lost in my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step, man, I got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Till the ending of our credits, life's such a movie
Filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you're inside it
You excited?

What you thinkin' about?
What you thinkin' about?

Hiding it all behind the smiles

You probably thought that you'd break my heart
You probably thought that you'd make me cry
But baby it's okay

'Cause I know everything

Now these tongues don't twist like they did before
It's hard to keep me up
And you are dry
But baby it don't hurt
Oh, like you thought it would
The more of you the merrier

Now we're lying about the nights
Hiding it all behind the smiles
Take a look at what you did

But baby it's okay

Cause everything you do leads to them
You think I could be your best friend
Baby I could fuck you right

Baby you could have it all

The clothes, the dreams, the sex, the house
Baby you could be a star

Baby all these things are your best friends
And nothings ever ever your fault
Nothings your fault baby, no
Baby you don't need your best friends
'Cause I got everything you want

Baby you could have it all

The clothes, the dreams, the sex, the house
Baby you could be a star

[If, all I could say is if
Promise me you won't regret me when you're touching on my skin
Let the wrong path come to me
One day I'm hoping that you, will remember me
When you fuck them you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me
Every Thursday
I wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you

Lips so French, ass so Spanish

I don't care about nobody else
'Cause I've been on these streets way too long
Baby I've been on this too long

It's getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another seroton'
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking till I can't hit another note
Ooh, but until then

I got you
Baby I got you
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you
So baby love me
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me
Because they all left me
I'll be different
I think I'll be different
I hope I'm not different
And I hope you'll still listen
But until then
Baby I got you
I got you
Girl I still got you
I got you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm paying for all my father's sins
So I will thank him for you
I'mma thank him for you
My serotonin's got a while to go
Girl, it's gone cause of you
It's been gone cause of you

They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I got heaven
Well I say, I am God

I never prayed a moment in my life
Girl I'm rewarded with you
I've been rewarded with you
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh
Let me kiss it for you
I can kiss it for you

They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God
I say, I have heaven
I say, I am God

Oh no
Oh no, oh no

You'll never make me stay so take your head off of me
I know your every move so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"

Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana

Dirty Diana, ooh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh

She said, "I have to go home 'cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight"
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone, sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "Unlock the door because I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, oh

Girl I'm open to anything that would get you into that zone
And understand that we're all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl you know what's in store
Baby I will stay up all night

Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes, cabbed all day
Took the bus back home, evictions on your door
Blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, 'cause I get it, you're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin' 'specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke, you need more bread
Now you got no rent, you blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day, hipster nights downtown
And your daddy don't know you're out

If they don't let you in, you know where to find me
'Cause if you wanna go again, you can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind, you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

XO, oh, don't you forget
XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO, yeah, XO, whoa

I love it when your eyes are red
Ah yeah, are you on my cloud yet?
'Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV?
Oh why, I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess, you look so depressed
And you're filled with regret and you feel like you gotta go home
'Cause these nights pass so much quicker then the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for your face lift
Lust over love is your mindset
Waken up with most of your side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
'Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

If they won't let you in, you know where to find me, oh
And if you wanna go again, you can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

XO, oh, don't you forget
XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO, yeah, XO, whoa

I need, I need something from you
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far

I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out, oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out, oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out, ooh
Just ride it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Oh yeah
Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas, all this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low, my eyes red but my brim low, that XO, she climbing
Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living
The party won't finish it's a fucking celebration (oh yeah)

For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work you don't gotta check the sky
We been going all night, till light

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys

You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up them teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out

Work that back till I tire out
Roll that weed, blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high

Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right

You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

And now I'm poppin' yeah
Ain't nobody showed me how

And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot every time you hear me playin' in the club

You never thought that I would ever go this far
(Never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential could never last this long

You can pick my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
'Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some choppers on the car
What kind of caps I got the finest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good [x3]
I ain't scared of the fall [x4]
I felt the ground before [x4]
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall

Mama I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
Where it goin', no telling
But to make room, I'll vanish
Call a friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexis
I let my niggas test it
I'm always worth a cent
Best believe I'm already spent
My blunt full of BC
My cup full of Texas
Flowing on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "who's next?"

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good [x3]
I ain't scared of the fall [x4]
I felt the ground before [x4]

You say you don't need to go, don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up, girl, I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind and expectations were not in sight

You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected, girl you're such a masochist and I ask, "Why?"
And you reply

"I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So baby don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone

Baby please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little lie"

Then, watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
Ain't no offense though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street

La la la la la la la la

Bring out the glass tables

I'm fuckin' Kitana, you know I got Sonya, for days
My diamonds they kick Johnny Cage, Quentin Jackson Rampage
Plug out in ChinaTown, hit my cell and said he got that strength
I rush, he drop the price by the pound in China Town

I mean I just left the Versace store

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
I know that you like it, Versace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti, he give me the dozen, I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

Get that new Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Cooking the dope, like I work at Hibachi
Lookin' and watching, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
When I go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
These niggas, they wishing they knew ya
They coppin' the Truey, remixing the Louie
My blunts is fat as Repuschia
Different stripped shirt like I'm Tony the Tiger
I'm beating the pot, Call me Michael
None of you niggas can copy
Look at my closet Versace, Versace

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

King of Versace, Medusa my wallet
My car is Versace, tiger stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressing so nice, they can't even copy
You think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
My money my mission, two bitches they kissing my diamonds
Is pissin, my swag is exquisite
No Offset no preacher, but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds dey look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living
I'm draped up in gold but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I'm think I'm the don, but no Rocko
This the life that I chose, bought out the store can't go back no more
Versace my clothes, while I'm sellin them bows
Versace took over, it took out my soul

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but y'all never ever workin'
Throwin' money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin'

It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm feenin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only want balance when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsey
Like I'm a chemist, treat 'em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you 'cause I know it's depressing
Must think it's upsetting the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'm a get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got full of the act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but y'all never ever workin'
Throwin' money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin'

Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock 'em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'm a rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a broke paddle
I see you running with the sack,
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient,
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali, I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator, my house so big got marijuana acres
Pots in the pan, Quavo the baker, money in the jar, look like a saltshaker.

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Y'all niggas got work but y'all never ever workin'
Throwin' money in the club when you know yo' pockets hurtin'

'Cause I'm walkin' round with these hundreds
When I pull up in that Lambo
So fast you ain't even see me coming

Got a AK finna start drumming
You was talkin' shit behind my back
But now here a nigga you ain't sayin' nothin'
Young rich nigga live forever, my trap game A1
You say that I'm broke how dare ya
I ain't never goin' broke never ever
Your arms and your legs I sever
Then feed em to the sharks for dinner
Quavo too hot like a kettle
Young nigga and I keep the heavy metal

My chain is all gold, the Fendi to Gucci to Louie

Young rich nigga I take a toast
Finessin' Pablo, he gotta go
Up on the boat, finesse Pablo out his O's
Meetin' up with Carlito
I'm takin' the trip cross the globe
The dope that I smoke get you high, UFO
I see that you ain't gettin' it back, no repo
It's for me though, bitch adios
You standin' and lookin' like you seen a ghost
Maybe it's 'cause I'm in this Phantom Ghost

Piece saran while I'm playing with the dough, if the feds wanna talk, I just tell them I don't know

Diamonds come from Africa, sipping on lean and smoking loud
Feel like I'm on salvia, flipping the work with no spatula

He said, "Be safe lil' bruh, just hit me when you need some money"

Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I am a blessing and you are a curse
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don't need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial so you know I'm innocent
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense

When a nigga broke, he coming at your throat
Tryna' sell the coke but it really is soap
My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough
Shit get real, nigga tried to kill
All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don't give a fuck
Tryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck
Plug's like a socket, gotta keep the rocket
Tryna get a profit, running to that money like Sonic
All my cars robotic
No Master P, but "I'm Bout It" gone

If its anotha' nigga I gotta remix it
Flipping them patties like Krabby's
My shoes is Prada's or Bally's
Finessing since I can remember
My wrist so cold, December

Difference between me and you

Money and the power, you gotta have respect, Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

Young Rich Nigga, I'm draped up in Versace
I went up to the jeweler, when I left I'm playin' hockey
Bad bitches like it, she see Rarris and Buggatis
I'm poppin' bottles in the vip, she rollin' off a Molly
Fendi Prada Louie bally, I don't need a stylist
I'm takin' all my goons to Cali, then we hit the islands
Order up 500 1s, I throw it all it follies
Plug in Japan, so we kick it like karate
Bad bitch from Switzerland, her daddy G. O'Donnie
Every time I'm on the phone we talkin' 'bout some money
I weigh it up, and wrap it up, I ship it across the country
The streets a concrete jungle, play the game like it's Jumanji

Money and the power, you gotta have respect, Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

My pockets is sloppy, only buy Rarris and Gottis
My clothes are exotic, Versace you copy
Migo gang is my posse, takin' over like the Nazi's
I just got out the county, money old like Bill Cosby
Hunnid bands, in all hundreds, when I make it rain it thunder
Cop a Lam every summer, wrappin' bricks like it's a condom
I'm a rich nigga bitch, don't even think about licks
Slap a nigga with a stack, then I piss on that bitch
In the club sippin lean, but I'm still buying cris
Shawty wanna talk to Off-Set, bitch you ain't on the list
Don't mix the lean with the sprite, drink my mud out the seil

Money and the power, you gotta have respect, Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

Young Rich Nigga follow me like Twitter
All green diamonds on my neck look like the Riddler
Red white and green Louis bought them on the day of Christmas
I'm the teacher you the student put you in detention
I got the camic you my chef and put you in the kitchen
Now you dirty dancing boarding wippin washing dishes
I took yo main bitch and then I turned her to my mistress
Pull up in Audi pull up in Rarri whip full of net it is a mystery
The rich nigga of the century it's going down in history
Energizer bunny wrist keep going it got energy
Back then you ain't know me now that sack make you remember me
Got that 45 for my enemy tell the Lord forgive the sin in me

Money and the power, you gotta have respect, Benz coupe, Jaguar, G-5 jets
Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas, Young Rich Niggas

These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency
So I go buy a pint of lean

I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!

So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle
Never know when it's your last supper nigga, so you gotta keep you some disciples, gone!

If you ain't got heart you get ate up
Just tryin' to maintain and stay out that cell without breakin the law
But it's hard as hell, the man above for showing me love
I'm taking them trips to Beverly Hills, runnin' through hoes
And counting them M's, living life high like Invader Zim
Live for today and pray for the next, I only see money
G's on my specs, I sin everday just to get this success
I want it for me, y'all want it to flex
The difference between us it's clear as it gets
Niggas be fake so I show no respect

This shit gets so hetic a nigga start stressing
The kush ain't helpin', lookin' at my Smith and Wesson

You niggas be bitin' my style and I like it
But you niggas know you weren't rapping like this
Trend setter, I'm a trend setter
Knockin' them out like I'm Mayweather
Bando look like it's a homeless shelter
She poppin' that molly like Alka-Seltzer
Whippin' that dope with that terminator
Wrist is spillin' dope all on my Breitling bezel
My mansion got 80 acres
Trap underground, they calling me Undertaker
They wonder why I got the Bentley, the Fisker
I put in work and dedication
50 pairs, Giuseppe steppers
Maison Margiellas, they think I'm on Rocafella
The kid, they call me Slick Rick
I make up a script, they call me the storyteller
I got the Britney, the Whitney, the Iggy, we murdered Versace like Biggie
Fuck nigga we been in that Coogi, it's time to kill em' with Givenchy
Red bottoms, scenes are forensic
Designer frames, limited edition
Pushin' one button, my roof then is missing
Then put my Louboutin till out the kitchen
You turn on the radio you gon' hear every rapper tryna rap like the Migos
Fuck nigga wanna clone?
Been rappin' like this since No Label
Fuck the fame rather be rich
Been gettin' money, since No Label
You waiting' for it, then here it go, intro to No Label

QC, It's funny my nigga right
Cause everybody wanna sound like us
But they don't wanna give us the respect, right?
You fuck niggas gon' learn we started this shit
We the first niggas to come out the A, on that real street shit
That real Northside shit, holdin' their muthafuckin' county down
Not city nigga, county nigga
Tell another nigga to do it like us, nigga
QC the label, money on the table
Migo Gang, No Label!

Way back in the day nigga made No Label in a basement
Young nigga got all that talent
On the radio didn't have a placement
Linked up with the hood
OG Head Hancho, Migos
Then we took over the north
20 dollars to get your song played at Flamingos
Remember the days of hitting licks?
Every Christmas, had to be St. Nick
Payin' bills, tryna meet the rent
My mama she say that she sick of it
I had to go get to the Benjamin
Sorry Your Honor, I'm innocent
Money moves the commitment
No label, my life you witnessed it
From kickin' doors
Taking gold
What did I cash out on? I don't know
I will not tell on my soul
Cause Ion' know if the case closed
I know that you hate that Versace went gold
Now I'm walking round with a blue bankroll
Independent, never ever won't fold

See, I learnt the term from my nigga Biggie, right?
We went from ashy to classy
We went from having shit to fucking your bitch, my nigga
No Label, DJ Ray G
These my muthafucking brothers right here, Migo Gang
What niggas you know made a million in one summer without flipping bricks?
Ask your favorite rapper
I bet he say us, nigga
QC, the label
Hah! No Label!

Locked up on every mixtape
Quavo told me nigga wait
This is the only way we can escape
I realized it when I sat down for an 8
Grandma' told me and Quavo to be patient
Grandma' was a cancer patient
Before she died, she sat us down, said stay together and we're gonna make it
For you niggas don't know
Never really sold dope
But I kicked door
Free my nigga Willy, mane gave him to the dough
He didn't tell a soul
You making me sick to my stomach
I might go and vomit
You niggas is cloning
We not together cause you my opponent
Taking our style nigga we never loaned it
Labels wanna sign, that ain't on my mind
Critics and blogs, you know they ain't lying
Thirty thousand just to look at the time
Twenty five hundred for my Louboutin
Mansion Elan was our stomping ground
Our money big, your money minimized
Taking shots cause your buzz died
Cutting the top off the Lamb' make it circumcised
The world is fucked up but the strong survive

Haha, name your favourite club in Atlanta, my nigga
We ran that shit
We turned Mansion Elan
Into Migos Elan, nigga
We turned up sessions, in the Migos Playhouse nigga
Every strip club
Our main bitch, our side bitch, her side bitch, her side bitch worked there, nigga
We run this motherfuckin' city
We started new Atlanta
These niggas jackin' our swag, they better stand in line
And pay, bitch!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You rappers you wanna be thirty three still tryna copy me
Young rich nigga only 19 and you'd better acknowledge me
Fuck nigga you spitting and rapping like this without Migos consent want apology
The labels keep talking, the critics keep writing and
All because we gettin' currency
I think it's time for extortion
I'm killing you babies, abortion (Kidnap you niggas my Migos will torture you)
I told you I'd rather be rich than famous
Fuck nigga this is my label
These fuck niggas done stole so much goddamn swag, might as well sell it
The critics done said it, I might as well tell it
I'm Activist with my shirt off screaming fuck the world like Makaveli
QC the label! Solid Foundation!
Young nigga on the block with the work to the side
Come up trapping like a fundraiser
Fuck nigga you know I'm a Migo
If I don't have Emmitt, get poked with a razor

Which one of my cars should I drive today? (They all foreign..)
I don't know
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? (They all bad)
I don't know
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Whatever you with, we with it
Whatever you with, we with it
Whatever you with, we with it
Whatever you with, whatever you with, my nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing the button
My niggas ain't stressed they got money, whatever you with, whatever you with, you know that my niggas we with it

They copy the name, they copy the gang, they copy the slang (they copy my name)
Versace, Versace we brought that shit back and you niggas is lame
We hearin' the way that these rappers is rappin' that shit not creative
What's the difference?
We some young niggas that signed to no label
My squad is so deep in the club, your fans and your people don't notice you
All of my niggas got diamonds, they flashin' they look like a photoshoot
I pull up in valet, the Audi got soft top but my top is bulletproof
And now they want jugg and finessin'
Now they want 'sace the necklace
At first we didn't expect it and now we expect it
At first the flow they neglect it and now they respect it
I'm thanking God for the blessing, (to not have a rat in my session)
I know that this game is dirty Smith and Wesson

Which one of my cars should I drive today? (They all foreign..)
I don't know
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? (They all bad)
I don't know
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Whatever you with, we with it
Whatever you with, we with it
Whatever you with, we with it
Whatever you with, whatever you with, my nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing the button
My niggas ain't stressed they got money, whatever you with, whatever you with, you know that my niggas we with it

You must got the rabies, you bitin'
You copy my swag and I like it
Young nigga I'm for sale
Give em' hell!
Put a nigga on a mission, young nigga won't fail
Y'all pussy ass rappers, these niggas they wise
Never trap, never cap, never been in a trial
You with it, I'm with it, them hollows start spitting
These niggas they shaking like Diddy
Gotta pay the trap on my block, extortion
80 percent of your guap
No lie, Versace, it got me a fortune
Enormous money ain't never gone stop
Woke up this morning and I played the radio
Nigga's remedial, sounding like Radio
Them niggas not talking just pullin y'all cards
Dunk a nigga, Vince Carter
Bullets have a nigga dancing like Carlton

Which one of my cars should I drive today? (They all foreign..)
I don't know
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? (They all bad)
I don't know
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow

Put that dope in the water, don't drown it
Add it up right now, bet it motherfuckin' lookin'

Young Offset trappin' in your area
Jungle fever, got the white and I marry her
I see Justin Bieber, the ghost is way scarier
Hit a juug, fifty bags of the good cannabis
All these other conversations irrelevant
If you ain't talkin' bout Benjamin Frank
Gold fingers like a trophy and painting
Got the 45., turn you to a sharp painting
My pockets is healthy, Zanotti Giuseppe
My money is stretching, my money athletic
Tyler Perry, makin' movies, they epic
I'm not the one from Cuba, that's my necklace

It topped the chart, nigga, so add it up
"Versace", it got us a M and 'em
Don't believe me, fuck nigga, then count it up
Stealing my flow, we come to your show
Put you on camera and we embarrass ya
Fuck your management, and your manager
You is a amateur, choppa'll damage ya
Trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
Trapper turned rapper, my mama happy
On the block trappin', don't serve undercovers
Snakes in that grass, they gon' get you on trouble
If I get jammed, put that on my mama
That I won't tell on my brother
In the bando and I'm countin' the fuck out the p's
Got rich off a pot and some water

I got the antidope try to come juuggin' and I'm bustin' your cantaloupe
I'm trappin' out of the bando, still got tools like Rambo
I'm feelin' like Harry Houdini
The pack was just here did you see it
The plug he be here any second now
If he didn't then something went down
We losing our bags, gotta go to the stash
At the age of 19, I was running from the task
Put it on my mama, no flex, no brag
Young nigga been had cash
Just me and Rel Money got rich off a half a bag
That's why they mad

Call me what you want but you can't call me broke
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture, Michelangelo
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

I got the antidope
I'm feelin' like Scarface, Al Pacino comin' off a banana boat
And how the fuck 200 Migo touchin' down in Mexico
Fuckin' around with Eduardo, told me that he know Armando
Armando fuckin' with Carlos, Carlos wrappin' 'em up in the barcodes
Ridin' around with that Scotty in brand new Bugattis
OG Miley Cyrus, snakes tryna give me the virus
But I got that antidope like I know science but I'm no scientist
Fuckin' around with them bombs but I am no terrorist
Piss on your bitch that R Kelly shit
I'm on Mount Everest sippin' on medicine

Call me what you want but you can't call me broke
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture, Michelangelo
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

Austin Powers, you niggas be takin' my Mojo
Young nigga I got the antidope
Coke and baking soda minerals
I got a brick in the figure 4
Young nigga I never make honor roll
But I know how to add up them digits
Whippin' and cookin' and flippin' chickens
You say you got money but pussy nigga you don't have a witness
'Cause I've never seen it
I'm a rich nigga I mean it
Keep talkin' bullets go through yo' beanie
I'm in a Phantom Ghost call that shit Casper
Young nigga plugged in like adapters
Stomp yo' ass out like an Alpha
Ahead of you niggas you still in the first chapter

Call me what you want but you can't call me broke
Pull up with that choppa and a telescope
Got 50 chickens in with me, runnin' around in my city
Young rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys, rich nigga trappin' out Bentleys
We makin' a motion picture, Michelangelo
I'm seein' the snakes in the grass - shhh!
I got the antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope
Antidope, antidope, antidope, antidope

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Started with a dollar and dream
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly

Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
'Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
(On) camera like Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator

I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
Now when I wake up I look at my label
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

Fuck!
Must be kidding me
Slam my nigga
Nah, nigga don't play with me
Migo!

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
They say the nigga that robbed you is in the trap right now
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
Nigga better stop playing with me

You know that they taking your style?
It's all on the radio, like right now!
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
Migo pockets sloppy like lasagna, nigga stop playing with me

Who the fuck said QC we ain't on top? Gotta be kidding me
Who the fuck said YRN2 gon' flop? Must be kidding me
The niggas that didn't believe in me
The people that didn't believe in me
Versace, Versace it topped the charts
Now I'm on BET and MTV
Remember back then watching Oprah?
Now I'm on the sofa with Oprah
Louboutins all on her sofa
No strings attached cause these loafers
OG gas pack got the odor
Green like Shrek that's an ogre
Taking my swag and exposure
Pull up to your house and foreclose ya'

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
They say the nigga that robbed you is in the trap right now
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
Nigga better stop playing with me

Thought I fucking told you fuck nigga better stop playing with me
Hop out with the dirty stick, the drum, holds infinity
My bitch ridin' down with 50 chicks in an SRT
I ain't make it out of high school, it ain't no shame in me
I'm richer than my teachers, damn I know I bet they mad at me
With yo' red light on, in the bando get it like Krispy Kremes
Hit the pot with the left hook, Quavo-Kareem
You ain't never seen a mountain of snow on that triple beam

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
They say the nigga that robbed you is in the trap right now
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
Nigga better stop playing with me

All of you niggas you mimic me, you kidding me? Literally
Controlling the block with good quality
Hurricane in the kitchen, a catastrophe
I'm number one you other niggas after me
Wrapping my bitch up in diamonds from Tiffany's
Everyday a holiday, epiphany
All you pussy niggas talking and bickering
It don't even make no goddamn sense
Cuffing the same bitch I fucked that's my bitch
Whoosh, pack gone missing
Soon as its touchin my hand it's disappearing instantly
Diamonds on me looking like it's a photo
Giuseppe's and now they walking on komodo
Feelin' like Austin they stealing my mojo
Trapping and capping we selling that yayo

They say he ran off with the pack, goddamn
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
They say the nigga that robbed you is in the trap right now
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
Nigga better stop playing with me

If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andele
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate

Public Service Announcement
Where all my rich niggas at man?
Migo!

Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right
Lil' mamma, she keep looking at me (lil' mama!)

Hit it with the left, hit with the right

Beat it with the left, beat it with the right

If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andele
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate
Your main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape
Rich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga (rich nigga)
Broke niggas I can never get along with them!
Always been hated since a little nigga (always)
It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)

Ice cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Rich niggas on the right all night (rich nigga)
Broke niggas to the left by yourself (brokanese)
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?

If your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children
Last time I asked I dine and dashed and bitch I go in the building
Bad bitch make it clap, let me know ya
Young rich nigga on the couch talking to Oprah
Bottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me
I won't know how you feel till you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy

Is it 'cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind?
I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
Young nigga walking with Nina Ross
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me
I won't know how you feel till you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy

They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbon

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me
I won't know how you feel till you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy

Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses baby girl you trippin'
I don't know how you feel can you tell me
I know why you came
In this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me

Wassup Pablo? What's poppin'?

I need 'em, I want it

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds

J's hit my phone if you want a bird
My niggas out right now on the curb
You can get a re-rock
You can get a whole serve
We locked and now I can front you
Young nigga that's my word
Walk in the bando, look at all them birds
Bando get low, re-up on the birds
Got shooters on pronto
Don't got no undo
At the age of 17 I hit my first kick do'
Just me and Willie Mac, Offset
Shoutout Domingo
Then 12 tried to get me
For gang activity
The judge dropped the charge, and I thank lord
That's why I take this mic and I go hard

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds

Offset!
Just got the word, just got the birds
Shabba Ranks gold only kick it with Ferg
You think you finessing me? Run off with ya bird
You gotta be kidding me
Charles Barkley, I got that broccoli
Fuckin' these bitches committing adultery
Trap fulla babies like an elementary
Bando with burglar bars, plugged in with Italian mobs
Don't never put trust in a broad
I'm puttin' my trust up in God
I got birds, I got chickens, I got seagulls
Too many birds, my gun is an eagle
When I talk birds, I'm talkin' a kilo!

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds

The plug just hit my phone
For some funions, want an onion
Exotic crocodile skin Martens, call me Dundee
Tito want a brick, chico gotta cross the country
Carlito for a hundred, gave bout 50 to my mama!
I'm an OG in my hood, no Aretha, well respected
Toucan Sam pigeons, call me Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
I see falcons on a daily basis, Takeoff Arthur Blank
Whippin' chickens in the kitchen
Trap smell like a septic tank
Rockin' gold everything, talkin' bout jewelry not the sink
I don't need no translator, I comprehend in a way
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no englo
All he knows is "andale"
I got bandos for the L-O
State-to-state, no real estate

Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird

Hopped out my mothafuckin' bed
Hopped in the mothafuckin' coupe (Skrr)
Pulled up on the Birdman (Brr)

You got 50 whole bands, you'll be my sponsor (just for the night)
Them snakes on the plane, me and Cognac-conda (condas)
Yeah
I might piece him up and let my partner smoke him
Chuck E Cheese, I'm about pizza and my Rol' on
I'm a gangster, I don't dance, baby I poke
Right now I'm surrounded by some gangsters from Magnolia
I heard I put it in the spot, yessir she told me
My niggas muggin', these niggas YSL only
I heard my Nolia niggas not friendly, like no way
But we not friendly either, you know it
Yeah thumbs up
I've seen more holes than a golf course on Donald Trump's course
My bitch a tall blooded horse, nigga, bronco
And if you catch us down bet you're not gon' trunk us
You got a body, lil nigga, we got a ton of 'em
You got some Robin's, lil nigga, we got some Batmans
I let that choppa go "blocka, blocka," get back, son
You got them MJs, nigga, I got them Jacksons (racks)

But really what is it to do
When the whole world constantly hatin' on you?
Pussy niggas hold their nuts, masturbatin' on you
Meanwhile the fuckin' federal baitin' on you
Nigga tell me what you do
Would you stand up or would you turn to a pussy nigga?
I got a hundred things to do
And I can stop rappin' but I can't stop stackin' fuckin' figures

Yeah, I'm from that mothafuckin' 'Nolia, nigga
Birdman'll break a nigga nose, lil' nigga
You need to slow your fuckin' roll, lil' nigga

We won a hundred mil' on fights, lil' nigga
A hundred bands, sure you're right, lil' nigga
I keep some AKs on my flights, lil' nigga
Birdman Willie B
Smoke some stunna blunts, now my eyes Chinese
Hundred K on private flights overseas
Choppas City nigga, free BG
Bentley with the doors all 'round, not a Jeep
Rich nigga shit, smoke two pounds in a week
Can't find a bitch that don't know we them streets
Bitches know that I am Birdman, that's OG

But really what is it to do
When the whole world constantly hatin' on you?
Pussy niggas hold their nuts, masturbatin' on you
Meanwhile the fuckin' federal baitin' on you
Nigga tell me what you do
Would you stand up or would you turn to a pussy nigga?
I got a hundred things to do
And I can stop rappin' but I can't stop stackin' fuckin' figures

Nigga I'm a crack addict
Thought about lettin' them get a cut, then I went and snagged at it
The new Boosie Badazz at it
I'ma drop a nigga life, just like a bad habit
I stick to the ground like a mothafuckin' rug
I'm a big dog, lil' fuck nigga you a pug
Lil' bitch clean your drawers before you think you're a thug
Before I be in front your shows, just like your pub
I ain't even lyin', baby
I swear to God I ain't lyin', baby, no
First I'll screw you without these pliers, baby
I might dap you like, "good try, baby"
Big B livin', baby
Them boys on my left throwin' up Cs
I promise their mama see them this week
And I don't break promises with my Ds (them my dogs)
I want Ms and cheese, mister Mickey Ds
She know I am a beast, I am so a beast
In Miami I swear they don't got good weed
Wiz Khalifa can you send me some weed please?


Yeah, overseas, nigga, top floor, clear windows, nigga
Glass house, drankin' GT, you understand?
We in that Red Light District, you understand?

These bitches and these niggas know that they can't play around here
I call the spot elementary 'cause I keep a K around here
All my Hatians if you play they make you grady baby
I might shoot you in your head and that is no more thinking
Pussy boy I'll leave you dead and call it dead-ication
I put Act inside my drink, they call it medication

Hold up, pull up, roll up, pour up
Ounces in a soda
Push up on your bitch and shawty I didn't even know her
See this hood I throw up, realest one I ever seen
ATL, call it XXL, 'cause we stay spittin' shells outta long magazine
Real nigga got a crown, better own that thing
If the game got a throne, bet I'm on that thing
Beloved dope dealer and a well known King
And a killer 'pending on how you put your spin on things
You know how many suckers get ahead I've seen?
'Bout the same amount of pussy niggas dead I've seen
You know how many bitches in the bed I've seen?
They like asking me how much bread I've seen
More than enough, in God we trust
You love a real niggas then fuck with us
But if you got a problem with it then fuck, what up

Got your bitch riding everything but the bus

Fuck a officer, Akon what it do bruh

Sit down and get rich like a booker

Feeling like I'm on a blue dolphin
Nigga roundin' round with like hella choppers
Every time I need new surgery I gon call her my head doctor

Check out my attire, this expensive fabric
We can wrestle just like Randy Savage
My jewelry as cold as an attic

These niggas thought that they knew it but they don't know it now

Hopped out my bed and hopped right in a foreign
Bitch don't get close, this a mothafuckin' warning
Suck that dick good, I'm the mothafuckin' warden
She runnin' away from my weed like it farted
She don't wanna swallow so I put it on her neck
I beat that pussy up, she loud as a parade
I got 1 million but only 10 in the bank
I taste a sample, I only buy if it's dank
I cook fishscale, and sang to her at the same time like Tank
I was born in '91, 23 with a whole lotta stain
5 star mothafucka
Baby can you feel my pain?
All my diamonds need to be drained
I got a gangsta bitch that's gon' bang
And I got racks up, I can't complain
And all my dogs, they're dirty, check for mange
And all I gotta do is reserve your brains

Never loved a bitch but I love money
In the church payin' my tithes with drug money
Went and got a new plug, got mama a new house

Couple bitches, good weed that how a nigga chill
Top floor, penthouse, still crackin' seals

My car is fast, I should drag
Versace white, Ku Klux Klan

King of lions, who let these cats rattin' out of the house?
Houston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch

We roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though
Suck it till you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound

Stop playin', look bitty boy, you're a duck

Little nigga, you know what it was
You know what it is, you know what it does

These hoes just roll me a blunt
And you know that they stuffy, they cannot be empty

Snoop Dogg, I might go ahead and bone
I'm big ballin', bitch put me inside the dome
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the tight way)

How many times have I asked are you well?
How many times have I popped a perc pill?
How many homies at home on the bail?
How many times have I told you you shell?

You can roger that like my motherfuckin' buzz (Losie!)

You did my nigga wrong, I know it, it was last summer

I could never call, not a fed, not a cop
Niggas sit on the bench and I said do y'all
YSL scream "fuck the rest" 'cause we got right now
Niggas asked me "Am I sure?", and the Bentley said "Yeah"
That little bitch ask for a purse and you know I said "Yeah"
She gone act just like a clerk when them feds in there
She might act like she know Bird when them players in there

Dressed in Balmain (Fresh)
Dropped a hundred on the whole thing
Inside cost a whole thing
And I'm a, give you my all, first my whole name
I'm in her mouth just like Colgate
I'm really feelin' super light, aye
Hate me
Like a hate ladies man, like bait
Hop inside a Bentley with a red paper plate
Every time they hate I throw them bands like a bouquet
I ain't Ray J but you can be my Kim K
Feelin' like the flippin' yellow green on like a cape
I don't ever believe what Lil Kim say
Ballin' how you feel, you can jump in my league
Running to my head like a deal in this league
Man, everywhere she go, she ballin'
Yeah she got xans, she like, "Where Tar at?"
She don't gangbang, she say she bang gangs
And she'll fight, might knock 'em out the ring
Had a coke brick, she'll whip it like a whip

I just wanna nut, she say that is easy like a baker
She just want a nigga, I don't serve but I love maple
And that's why she gon' watch me like cable

Take kare of her
If I don't do nothin' in the world, swear to God I'm takin' kare of her

Take kare of lil mama, take kare of baby mama
Take kare of her
Take kare of her, take kare of her
Take kare of her

On a million, goin' to meet a billion
Bring the Bentley, you can keep the ceiling
Take a trip to Peru, baby suck my dog like Snoop
Blood gang, big ups so woo
Dinosaur bank roll, woo woo
H&amp;M ballin', ball a hundred ten
Throw my boy 6, bim bim
Baby keep that pussy
Baby keep that pussy clean, trill
Bought a castle with my last deal
Boy don't talk about no fad deal
Lil nigga you laaaaaaaaame, okay
I'm a put the pedal to the race
I'm a pull the pedal, not the brake
Ice inside my ring, you can skate

Yeah this shit cold like a case

That a nigga went and snitched on him with
All these mothafuckin' bitch
I'm the shit, Hell I'm the shit
I'm a build a hole for a snitch, not a ditch
Shit

And they wish they was the bitch they're hatin'
Salutations to my old hoes
And thank you for your participation
No chasin' from a girl though
She go harder than me on, okay
Gettin' wasted with my girl
Then we 69 till we need ventilation
You don't know about it
Gotta open new accounts cause the others overcrowded
Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin'
For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin'
She so bad, I don't know what to do with her
I know just what to do in her
Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight
I said I'm with my girl, tonight I can't fuck with you niggas
I'm a take kare of her

Got a Rarri with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' some business with the hat back
I'mma take a nigga head like a snatch back
I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap
Take a five hour rest, ball it cat nap

Treat her like a Bentley, take the top up off that bitch
I got hoes drinkin' syrup like a waffle on that dick
I made all my pockets grow like Pinocchio, lil bitch
Either way, money'll grow, just know I'm tryna get rich
Baby, I wanna cashout on you in it for my pride
Baby, I bought that Audi and I gave it to my mother
These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other
Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble
Hey I ran up my racks and I'm killin' 'em by the day
Treat her like she got tatted, she comin' with all that head
Not a big fan of acne, but she like it in her face
I'm in the West Coast bangin' like I'm in the A

Got a Rarri with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'mma take a nigga head like a snatch back
I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap
Take a five hour rest, ball it cat nap

I just copped the coupe, it came with twin turbo
Diamonds 'round my neck, they singin' like they Kirko
Thugger got me swung, got drinkin' all this purple
And I got 'em billionaires in my circle
So you know I'm bangin' back up in the Rarri
I got old money like when I played Atari
Counted me a million on my DVD
Coca, cocaina, I got recipes
Really makin' juggs, I was servin'
Cash Money, nigga, I know Birdman
I just want the cheddar, I just want the pesos
Rich Gang, YSL, came up off that yayo

Got a Rarri with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'mma take a nigga head like a snatch back
I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap
Take a five hour rest, ball it cat nap

Ass big, Hummer

Big B, stung her bzzzzz
Slime, anaconda
I became a problem
OG kush, fungus
Know me well, wonder
Pull up on a pussy nigga in a second
Young Thugga thuggin', pussy, Makaveli
Left pocket lettuce, right pocket relish
17-5, baby, sell it, Thugga!
Hop inside the coupe and drop the roof
'Cause I'm the mothafuckin' man, you dig?
Mama give me head, nut on her brain
And then I bought the bitch a brand new wig
I'ma pour up mud and now I'm livin' like a pig
Signed so many deals I think I got the best sig
I can write, I can write
Hear no evil, I see no evil
I ain't kin to Wayne
But I called the bitch and now she my mamacita
Big diamonds on me, mothafuckas lookin' like pimples
Don't let the fish eye fool you, bitch this a peephole
Play with my head, I'll bust your watermelon
Pink, I'm movin' slower than a caterpillar
I got a hundred thousand hoes, tryna get a million
I got a hundred thousand coupes and I don't keep the ceiling
I'm almost at the finish and you niggas still beginning
I got more money than Martin so I pour up more Remy
I just got back from Jimmy Fallon, me and T.I.P. sippin'
Four fours, tryna rob, oh no
I'm a fuckin' stunna
Ass big, Hummer
Birds, Alge Crumpler
Big B, stung her
Slime, anaconda

Roll OG kush, fungus
Know me well, wonder
Pull up on a pussy nigga in a second
Young Thugga thuggin', pussy, Makaveli
Left pocket lettuce, right pocket relish
17-5, baby, sell it
17-5, all my niggas, they gon' ride
Complete homicide, I'm a earthling in disguise
With a foreign body, diamonds wet with no wires
Screw that bitch with no pliers
No charger, pussy, die
Livin' like a mob boss, pussy nigga no I won't play
Nigga can't stand in front of me
I got my ice on, bitch ain't nothin' fugazi
Vintage swag, nigga, no 80s
And I don't speak Creole
But them niggas, they gon' look out every time I'm in Haiti
I got more money than you and you and you and you and you too
I ain't even crippin' but I got a mothafuckin' clue and it's blue
Damn, and I want you to guess, nigga
But if you're wrong, you gon' get the rest, nigga
I'ma put a lot of metal in his chest just like a vest, nigga
I'm a fuckin' stunna
Ass big, Hummer

If he tune his nose up, boy he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser
Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that?
They wouldn't know one thing about ya if ya zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back

Beat that bid an never crack, did that, sheesh!
Before I go without a sack, I swag pack
I spoiled my bitch and now she actin' like a brat

Bitch I'm bleedin' like a tat
Roll it, roll it, for me on ya back
Just for show, my diamonds yellow like a taxi

Pussy nigga better not look back
Or, or else I'm killin' 'em, hell yeah, that's a fact sheesh
There's blood all on my Timberlands
Make a nigga say "whaat?!"

I swear to God she feelin' 'em

She sucked like eight dicks, I call her Octagon
First you get that money then you get that power
If he tune his nose up, boy he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser
Bitch, I make it rain shower, ya dig that?

They wouldn't know one thing about ya if ya zip that
Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back

Beat that bid an never crack, did that, sheesh!
Bitch, I dig it, I eat ice cream with my chicken
Bitch, I'm rich just like a Simmons, not lil Diggy
If I got legs, bitch you know I'm gonna get it
She got good head, so she welcome to my Bentley
Big Bentley in that big Bentley, Bentley
Hop out with that semi, 'cause I know these nigga hear me
Is you mad bout Instagram on how I keep my pimpin'?
You keep that Ace of Spades, I'm sippin'

If you tryna run off, you know we pop ya noggin'
First you get that money then you get that power
If he tune his nose up, boy he on that powder
Now you walk around with 50 in your trousers
Diamonds boolin' on my chest, no fuckin' blouser

Hit 'em with that blocka-blocka, nigga get back
Beat that bid an never crack, did that, sheesh!

I'm lovin' your patience, turned all in this race
Ooh, long as you don't play, motherfuck what you say

We eatin', where is your plate? Aim at your head or your face?
Hannah Montana, my nigga gon' cook everyday, yeah, they bake

Eh, ho, what is your bargain? Bro, what is your bargain?
Eh, I pull up and arson all over your garden
Eh, I'm never gon' call you, I'm always gon' ball you
Eh, my diamonds cost more than whatever I chargin'
Now I'm bleedin', need a band-aid, on a rampage with' 'em AKs
Nigga, jewellery real gold like an Ace of Spades

These niggas fake-ballin' like a Powerade
Damn, this might be coward day
Yeah, this might be powder day
Sniff, shoot up, boot up (toot up), TMZ, sue us

And I ain't never been a rat, but I'm livin' ruthless
I show the pussy-bitch bankroll, now she can do us, no
And we the best, every time we come around
Boy, they root for us, true
And everybody hate Chris
But I got them racks up, now they Luda, yeah
Tell baby girl, I only wanna throat, flute us
Five thousand on Yeezys, they think I ain't Jesus
Get my ice out the freezer, it cost a lil' Beamer
She fuckin' my whoadie, yeah, lil'-bitty shorty
She think he adoring cause his pockets on Norbit
Play with me and these bitch-niggas gon' die
All I want is that head and that ain't no lie

These niggas vibe faker than a puppet

Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in
My nigga pot cook it so good he put his shoe in
Nigga, it's a gangsta party, why fuck is you in?

Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in
I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man

I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon

I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman
If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?
We thirty deep, we come from the streets, nigga, we mobbin'

I look like a dope boy, I know it
I know I'm gonna win it like Floyd
I became an important lil' boy
Money long like a sock with some shorts

My bitch white and she brown like port
Ed-umacation abort, bookin' these dorks
I jumped off the porch and went north
Whipped you some dope full of narc-cotics
YSL hardbody, I got 'bout 20 chickens in the lobby, baby
Ride It, ride It Kawasaki, saki
I don't speak English I
I fuck that mouth, I'm not sexist
I'm the big homie, I'm leakin'
Stick to the streets like I'm cement
I don't need no change, you can keep it
I don't want your verse on my remix
No panties she my secret
Got a hunnid bands on me I'm cheesin'
This the sequel, lookin' down like an eagle

Chain front big like its New Year's Eve
But my Rollie on fire like the first day of June

I neva seen a chick wit a body like that
Gucci Mane Lil Flap bitch I got it like that
Stuntin in the club wit my nigga Big Kap
Made the waitress come back wit 20 mo' stacks
Iced out chain got a iced out grill

Candy Escalade 26 inch blades
Throw back money from back in eighth grade
Ya dancin in the club so I know ya get paid
But I betcha you'd look betta wit these microbraids
Girls in the club like dat there stank
Showin off three or four rubberband banks
Me and HB keep a big bankroll pulled up in a Hemi wit the Lambo Doors
Me and yo chick in a red corvette
I neva had shit nigga what ya expect
Neva seen a young man paint so wet hood rich and my album ain't even dropped yet

Get in her ear and corrupt her mind

A mill worth of ice in these playa haters faces
A mill worth of ice Gucci mane good gracious
Got a sick flow and I think it's contagious

Tell these playa haters to check my Bds Benz

See a bad broad Gucci mane ill buy
The same dude you shop wit I'm his supplier
Gucci Gucci Gucci yours truly that's me
Hood rich or cocky I just might be

More ice on me than a game of hockey
If you want a mean dick you can ride in my six
Suck a good dick then I'll get your hair fixed
Gucci brake bricks down used to sell fifties
Watch on my wrist man it cost a buck fifty
King of the city Gucci mane Frank nitty
I'll gives a bitch a dove if she let me touch her tities

Gucci Mane make you look like you posed to look
Gucci shoes Gucci fit and a pocket book
Let you party like a rock star, ride in a boxcar
Have you gainin weight everyday eatin lobster
All you friends invited so you can bring a partner
Gucci in the hood sellin weed like a doctor
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house 'cause I'm always doing shows
Teamed up wit big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash road, flat shoals represent that
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy
Is it hot in here nigga or it's just me

Smokin' purple weed under shade of palm trees

Maybe the ice in my ear, or my bracelet
But she look like the type that could take a dick
Young Gucci Mane, don't kiss me baby you can kiss my chain
Ya gotta be a dime piece,
Just to look at the rocks in my time piece
I come through in a drop top Jag, or Old-School Chevy
Wit da antique tags

Niggaz coppin ice we done done it already
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie

Got a lil buzz but Boo been too high

I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick
I tell her holla at Jeezy if ya wanna pop Cris
Get at Gucci Mane 'cause he on some lil shit
And you know I'm in da cut, grippin my 4/5

(Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X)
Don't let yo' mouth write a check that yo' ass can't cash
I'm the lawnmower man and yo' ass is grass

Gucci Mane make a nigga wear a shit bag
Actin' bad like a kid at Six Flags
I'll send some slugs at yo' bitch ass
In my hood ain't no love for yo' bitch ass
Fifty pounds in the trash bag
Anybody move then that nigga gettin' blast at
Hit a lick for 'bout fifty stacks
Niggaz trippin' talkin' 'bout Gucci bring the money back
Half a brick and I'm breakin that
I'm in the trap where the junkies at
I'm gettin' fat, fuck a jumpin' jack
Zay' drop a track the whole industry be jockin that
I'll put a hole in your stocking cap
Work ya like a bitch at the Body Tap
I stay strapped, blow you off the map
Niggaz hate behind my back, but when they see me give me dap

Uh...
I'm from the hood I'll punch your lights out
I took your jewelry, now I'm iced out (icy icy)
Gucci Mane got that 'caine in
I swear I never tuck my chain in
You just a thug gettin' traded
I'm a thug entertainin
Really I'm a street nigga
That chopper on the seat, nigga
All ready for that beef, nigga
Yo, Gucci gotta eat, nigga
I guess I'll see you when I see you nigga
I wouldn't wanna be you nigga
Now ain't that like a nigga
Tryin' to sound like a nigga
A lover not a fighter nigga
But let me see yo' lighter nigga

You see the bracelet on my arm, my necklace, my charm
I'm dangerous and armed with grenades and bombs
Y'all done slumped out with tons of ones
In tha club puttin' on like "I'm Dapper Don"
Yours truly, young Gucci all I do is hustle hard
Never had credit but used my 2000 Mastercard
Grimy and gritty, hotter than cookin with lard
Gucci Mane on the block again and I'm cookin ya boys
It's that grown man shit, nigga bring all the toys
When I snap they'll have to call the lieutenant and sarge
Bring the whole entourage, see she thinkin' you hard
And watch how quick I load the chopper bullets you gotta dodge
Uh... Gucci Mane on the track nigga
Zaytoven on the track nigga
Big Cat, Laflare nigga
I'm the lawnmower man, nigga

Gucci Mane (Gucci Mane)

Two pounds and I'm like real big
Stacking double see the nigga so big
I got to get it, got to get it, got to run my money up
Got to get it, got to get it, got to run my money up [3X]

Uh! I'm going on a Trap-A-Thon
Gucci Mane like Gotti I'm the Dapper Don
Uh! Hundred G's in my Gucci bag
So if you look at me wrong I'ma do yo' ass
Uh, Gucci Mane, I'm the bread and butter
Run trap, sell crack, nigga spread your hustle
Uh, pockets fatter than Oprah Winfrey
Gucci Mane I'm the baller of the fucking century
Uh, iced out like Babe an' them
I can sell mo' records than Shade an' them
Uh, Gucci Mane you're a cocky fella
I make it rain so you better get you umbrella
Uh, and my watch is on another level
Clusters of diamonds and they bunched together
Uh, why you talking so much shit?
Yo bitch, 'cause I'm so rich

Okay somethin' white like Michael Jackson
Bust the shit out the rubber then I start to trappin
Gucci Mane got the lone ticket
Run stack for the midget nigga fuck with me, uh
Shawty say he short a couple stacks
The diamond chain on my neck is doing jumping jacks, uh
Yo' money short like Spud Webb
Bend down nigga broke nigga need help, uh
My money talking like Dikembe
Gucci Mane I make a Friday out of Wednesday, uh
Mo dough than CVS
Still making moves, thuggin' with S-Y-S, uh
All my shows better be whippin up
J's keep the ash scrubs when we pick it up, uh
And me and Cad in a Hum-Vee
Yellow diamonds got me lookin' like a bumblebee, uh

Gucci got a plug, for the square face
Got them quarter ki's, I call 'em chicken wangs
Got the gangster peas, I call 'em collard greens
We got them ex pills, we call 'em skitters mayne
Gucci on the grind, catch me at the spot
Got some cocaine jumping out the damn pot
Get some cool water, it's too damn hot
All I want for Christmas is the dopeman knot
Hustle harder, be smarter
We gonna eat when I bring it out the water
36 O's, for the 17
Five for the drive, 17-5

(Verse 5: Jody Breeze)
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee

Diamonds on my joint
Got my chevy moonwalkin
10 bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
My watch, 35 pounds of kush
My ring, 36 oz's my nig
My bracelet, 500 lbs of mid
A Gucci wrapped tour bus
Y'all hoes follow us
Party pack pills man
Hoes gonna swallow us
Naturally a loner
But love my kid
Mix the soda with the cola

Trap House times 10

Jumping out the phantom, don't you think I'm handsome?
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Betcha baby-daddy ain't icing like the kid be
Gotcha baby-momma front seat of the Ferrari

Gucci Mane the fly baby, I'm that guy
Girls' eyeballs pop when I ride by
My money long as a limo
Just to show off I put my wrist out the window
Ride through the six, little kids scream bingo
Fell off in the spotlight
Ay, let's mingle
Then the DJ play my new single
The club got crazy
All the hos went psycho

She a very freaky girl
Don't bring her to mama

Mac Bre-Z:Girl he geeked up (repeat 3 times)
Gucci:Bitch I might be (repeat 3 times)
Yeah!

East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
Pass that bubble thrax and put this bean on your tongue
Now everything was gravy till your bitch came in
'Bout the same time that that thang kicked in
Now she ain't really pretty but she got a nice body
I'm geeked up thinkin' this Buffie The Body
Ain't your name lil Trina cause you look like Janet Jackson
I'm off three double stacks and I'm lookin' for that action
Gucci Mane you stupid man I love the way you flowin
Ridin' in my drop but I don't know where I'm goin'
On two eighty five I keep ridin' in a circle
The inside of my ride smellin like a pound of purple
Gucci is your time give me five more minutes and a cold orange juice 'cause I'm really really trippin'
Went to the strip club and request that I'm da man
The next thing you know I was throwin' rubberbands

Shawty tellin' me she ain't neva suck no dick
Neva took a pill or neva ate a bitch
You a lie but I ain't gonna get upset right now
But I wish I had a lie detector test right now
You say you marry well bitch you might be
But I bet your husband ain't Icy like me
She stand on B.C. in my ashy black tee


When dem dope man nikes and dem jore ass jeans-Jordache Jeans

I don't pay her but I still keep that thrax on me
Imma the shit in East Atlanta baby ask about me
Pop one pop two two halves that's three
Ain't no waffle house baby hell I can't eat
Gucci hood like your hoodman hes so extreme
Wearin doces in the club cause you know the boy geeked
Top the top on that thang let you see my seats
We've been rollin' rollin' rollin' we ain't slept in weeks

Gucci Mane (the fly nigga get your mind right
Or a crys by the twelve like a case of budlight
Sell a cush by a bell so you know might shit tight
See I'm 30 in the morning on a all night flight
I'm high like Fabo hood like Shawty
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gonna party
Got a party pack of pillz that's at least bout 40
Ill pour dem in your hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pillz call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pillz man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

Ay wassup Gucci Mane. Why you sweatin so hard? Is you rollin' or somethin'.
Shit well baby I might be. But got damn what is you doin'. You jockin a playa. You ch-Chewy ova here right. Look I ain't

Tailor made outfit,
Hollerin at a thick chick,

Ridin' in a mayback,
Headed to the racetrack,
Sippin on konyak,
Big fat dro sack,
Seat laid back,
And actin' like I'm all that,
Tell me what you call that?
Tell me where yo broad at?
Chillin' wit a mack throwback wit a strawhat,
Hataz mean mug me,
Girls wanna hug me,
Everything's lovely,
Tippin on bubbley,
Pull up at the club, valet park the car,
Fell of in the club then I bought the bar,
Girls choose me cause ima superstar,
They takin' snap shots of my entourage,

Left the barber shop wit a real tight fade,
Hit tha car wash let my rims get sprayed
I'm fresher than fresh,

My rims still spinnin but my car is parked,
It's after dark, we left the park,

Everybody know me I'm the a10c, ask my boy ZT,
Too hot for radio or mtv, tell BET to come and see Gucci,
I'm a trap star, ghetto celebrity, pretty girls wanna get in bed with me,
And these pretty girls wanna give head to me, but these pretty girls gotta bring bread to me.

Even if I have to kill you bitch my son I got to feed
I'm at the mall, I'm poppin' tags with shopping bags so style

Whoa, hold up my nigga you must don't know I gotta get ya
You told yo boy I got a big ass, but boy my nine is bigga
I'm waitin on him to pull up at the spot I see he clean
That boy sittin' on them things, a iced out chain, and big ass rings
He said lets go to the movies, I told him lets go to the room
This nigga think he really got a freak, but mine is do the fool
We get to the room, I let him rub, I let him get a lil touch
I told him hold up stop, let me go to the bathroom freshen up
I went out the bathroom window, met with Gucci glock in purse
Kicked in the do', shot him in his head, took his cheese and left him murked... I'm that Bitch!

Gucci Mane Big Cat

Growin' up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same lil' nigga that taught your brother to smoke

But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move is up on the tube
Whoever said bein a gangsta was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy

To be a gangsta is a full time job
A bad a boy but I ain't [unsure]
The pays good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'ma see ya degraded

I'm never scared but I'm thinkin' ahead
Because they don't bury the scared man they bury the dead

I'm ex-con but I'm out on bond
Wave bye to the bad guys, Teflon Dons

Got my name in the paper and my face in the news
Gucci Mane, Lil'flare
Ev'rybody Ev'rybody know me
Ev'rybody know me nigga
Gucci mane, Lil'flare I'm a real OG (nigga) [2x]

Take it to the street nigga, lets go there
There ain't nothing 'tween us pussy nigga but air
But you better prepare 'fore you fuck with the flare
I'll have you role round, frickin up with the chair

See I don't fight fair na I don't fight fair
Gucci Mane'll put that ass in intensive care
Matta fact if ya see me fight a grizzly bear, I suggest you help the fuckin' grizzly bear

Tha ain't no pussies ova here, na it's just Jeez
There ain't no time for no talk, nigga cock it and squeeze
Got these ho type ass niggas weak at the knees
Shoot two twenty-threes they'll chop down trees

Gucci Mane outta jail man, what I'm gonna do now
That Jeezy lil bitch ass thinkin' out loud (2x)

You motha fuckas must don't know who they mess wit
I'm that outlaw wild wild west shit
I'm on that ??two clipse ak'n'invest shit?? (needs correction)
You mothafuckas must don't know who you fuckin' with

I'm not a kid, Gucci Mane full grown
So bring the choppers, leave the nines at home
And call the coppers 'cause I'm aimin for domes
I have ya call full backup on the phone

The franchise, but Gucci Mane ain't wearin no white tee
The niggas hate the fact that niggas so icy
But fuck that, niggas don't gotta like me
Cause seein niggas shit'split in site of me

Pitchin be high off the weed like a kite be
I took ya bitch through my hood just to site see
I screen niggas so I stay on the skreet shit
And if there's drama then it's you I'ma deal with

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Yeah! It's ya boy black magic
My nigga young snead, let's go

Ay man I walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Since I moved to the south, my slang got colder
Walk got pimper, cane with the limper
Treat my bitch right, always lobster and shrimp her
Flatbush ave I'm the number one contender
Simpson road fashion, poppin' wheelies on the ninja
Whip game hot, flow cold like the winter
Ball hard if niggaz got blocks like a center
Time for me to switch it up, bigger car bigger truck
Got the new house and that too was big as fuck
And this a must that you see me blow
Lil' nigga hold the weight like my ceo
Now it's back to the business, we eat sleep and shit this
Take this, shoot him and any fuckin' witness
Always on some pimp shit, never on some simp shit
At big cat records nigga e'ryday is christmas

We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Big whips, big chips, we live this
Smoke kush, pop crist', fuck bitches
Us young niggaz out there handle our business
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Big whips, big chips, we live this
Smoke kush, pop crist', fuck bitches
And send them goons if them goons on our shitlist

(Repeat 2x)
Guess what I heard? Gucci mane back
Guess what I heard? Man he reppin big cat
Guess what I heard? Young snead on some other shit
Tell them fuck niggaz they can miss us with that sucker shit

I'm addicted to the trap, down with big cat
And you know he got a strap, why you wanna try me?
And you know I gotta scrap, you a country boy
So you know I gotta trap (ay!)
Cop the fruity watch just to hurt the haters' faces
Big cat chain with the big cat bracelet
Big cat bracelet with the big cat bracelet
Countin' twenty mill' in the big cat basement
I heard, I heard, word on the street
Gucci fell down now he back on his feet
Anti-social, he don't really socialize
What'cha call that? I call it street certified~!
A hundred thou' sold no lie
So call the fire truck, cause gucci on fire
And he pulled up in a 'rrari
And if he hurt your feelings when he did then he sorry!

(Chorus - repeat 2x)

I'm a certified pimp shawty, never seen me cake a hoe
Bad bitch one night, next day another hoe
A young'un with a bankroll, listen what I date 'em fo'?
Benefits and everythang that I can go and break 'em fo'
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Smoke kush, pop crist', real pimp shit
Big chains, big whips on 6's
I got money on my mind so fuck bitches
I'm in the coupe with the top back, lamborghini do's on it
Had to do it b-I-g, so I throwed the 4's on it
Tote a fo'-fo' so the kid scream 'fuck a hater!'
All black, long part, somethin' like the terminator
Call me the exterminator, sprayin like the orkin man
You don't want no part of that we deeper than a marching band
We trap, we slang, we hustlers
And stay away from you motherfuckin busters

(Repeat 2x)
Guess what I heard? Gucci mane back
Guess what I heard? Man he reppin big cat
Guess what I heard? Young snead on some other shit
Tell them fuck niggaz they can miss us with that sucker shit

I hit for a hunnit' and I bought me a drop
I pulled up on her and panties just drop
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop
I'm from (?) give a fuck bout your block
High speed chasing, give a fuck 'bout the cops
When I see 12, put the dope in my sock
Niggas be rappin', I came up off rocks
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin', I feel like I'm Pac
They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself 'cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas actin' like bitches, niggas all in they feelings
These niggas acting like women
Drowning in money, I'm swimmin'
These bitches acting like pigeons
I just want a couple million, I just want a couple million
And I'm still loyal to the game
These other niggas man, they lame
I really sold cocaine, Gas stank propane
Glock forty, nigga bang, Blood, Crip, nigga bang
I heard ya got ya chain took and had to get another damn chain
21 nigga the gang, slaughter ya daughter the gang
Mac 90 got range, young savage got aim
I bought a new Rollie, its plain, you niggas best stay in yo lane

I'm covered in money, I'm drippin
These niggas they telling, they snitchin'
So we gon' fuck on all they bitches, I be round lot of henchmen
Moving like I'm John Gotti, 12 gauge nigga shotty
Hit 'em all in the body, I just caught another body
Lord forgive me I'm sorry, I can't help it, I'm a street nigga
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle

Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

Lord forgive me for my sins, I was struggling tryna win
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga tryna chase them m's
Cooking up crack its illegal, riding with a desert eagle
I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal
Hunnid pounds of Cali reefer, Call of duty heat seeker
Pull up on ya in a regal, window down nigga creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal
In the trenches, niggas beefing, I remember not sleeping
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take

Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case

Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't help me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more

Shootouts on shootouts on shootouts on shootouts
Young nigga done been on them shootouts
Where yo ass was at dog when we was at when we hallow a nigga with the 2's out bitch
Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in
Tied his partna up in the cut
Me and Lil Harold had took a laptop
That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped
Me and Johny tried to rob everything
Mookie tried to tell us, do the right thing
Larry died man I cried twice
Chevy went down the road nigga twice
They tried to give my nigga Teetay life
Tip and Metro nigga ready to fight
I keep lotto with me, real ripe
Pussy niggas, nigga we don't like
Free Lil Tooto, he gon' open a fight
RIP Tayman that's why I got that knife
I don't get excited about the fame
Bitch I'm still with the same gang, bitch I still claim the same thing
Still take a pussy nigga chain

Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more

12 can't arrest me no more, ain't no roaches on the floor
Ain't no flowers in this clique, ain't no flowers in this shit
We done cut the snakes off, had to cut them niggas off
Niggas don't wanna see you with nothing, unless you giving these niggas something
I had to get me some money, bitch and that drum hold a hunnid
You run up, you know that I'm gunning, 2Pac nigga, thugging
A lot of niggas changed on me, I just bought some chains on me
I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie
Mookie told me I deserve it, momma told me I deserve it
I know if Tayman was alive, he would tell me I deserved it
I got the sack and start splurgin', balling like I'm James Worthy
Pussy niggas ain't worth it, before I did some other murders

Man I feel like I deserve this shit
I bought a Bentley because I deserve a new whip
She cheated on me so yes I deserve a new bitch
These niggas wasn't with me, they didn't have me grind for this shit
I buy some chains for the bro's, I don't got shit for these ho's
Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes

Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom

Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, whoa
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke

Can't change on my game, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real

I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
Makin' sure my kids happy
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me

I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"
My old ho sayin', "Boy you growed up"
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliante, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous

Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?

Peel a hotbox when it's time to ride, dog
If you froze up last time, you can't ride, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog

Go against the gang, that's like suicide, dog
Go against the gang, that's like suicide, dog
Walk ups only when I'm shooting a drive, dog
We woke the neighbors up, at first the street was quiet, dog
Have you ever did a real homicide, nigga?
Have you ever made a nigga mama cry, nigga?
Do or die nigga gotta do or die, nigga
If you ain't the one doing it, you gon' die, nigga
Sometimes I look at God and I wonder "why," nigga
Why my niggas had to be the ones that had to die, nigga
They killed one, we gon' kill 5, nigga
Winter time, we gon' set your block on fire, nigga
Yeah, yeah, like the 4th July, nigga
Broad day, lettin' them bullets fly, nigga
Pull up with a stick like I'm Sah, nigga
Gang gang, dare a nigga to try it, nigga

I don't wanna go to sleep, I'm way too high, dog
I can't get no sleep, I swear I'm way too high, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
Peel a hotbox when it's time to ride, dog
If you froze up last time, you can't ride, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
I see dead bodies when I close my eyes, dog
