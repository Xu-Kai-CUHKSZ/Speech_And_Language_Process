I couldn't help but overhear you talking to yourself
How she slipped right through your hands
And in between all of the four letter words
You said your never gonna understand
You gave her everything you thought she ever wanted
Now all you want is gone
Your Just One of Many Broken Hearted
Wondering what went wrong

Welcome to the club
Don't be thinking you're the only one
Who's heart was in a hit and run
While you looked the other way
As you're howling at the moon
Take a look around the room
At all your fellow fools of love
Welcome to the club

Over in the corner is ol' Larry John
Getting over wife number two
And sitting next to him is a regular here
They're as lonely as me and you
We got one thing in common
When we walked in
A memory we're trying to kill
Swearing up and down we'll never try again
But we know we will

Welcome to the club (x3)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Swingin' doors
Neon lights
Hardwood floors
It's Saturday night
Got on my dancing boots
I've got a cold Lonestar
I've got a two steppin' mind
And a honky tonk heart 

I've got a two steppin' mind And a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 

It's happy hour when I get there
Pretty girls, man they're everywhere
There ain't no way to keep us apart
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 

I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 

I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart
I need a five-piece band with a fiddle and steel guitar
Someone to hold when the music starts
I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart 
Hey, I've got a two steppin' mind and a honky tonk heart

Some people say I'm one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked
Sometimes I feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book
All the places I've played and the money I've made still I've got nothing to show
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you

You put your whole life into somethin' you love and you never get that one big break
That'll take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage
But a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you

I gave it all I had every night for all these years
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through
Just love me
'Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you

I gave it all I had every night for all these years
Pourin' out my soul till it was gone
I spread myself so thin and I'm just barely hangin' on
But tonight I'm with you and you can carry me through
Just love me
'Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you
Oh, is you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I've lead a lifetime fightin' this land
Workin' for nothin' with these dry, callused hands
I'm a slave to the sun, It ain't cuttin' me no slack
Gets me beggin' whenever I look back

Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been

Three generations countin' on me
To work this farm keep it in the family
Well, I've done all I can and it's past becomin' clear
That I can't hold out much longer here

Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been

Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been
Ain't no angels where I've been

People ask me what you doin' son
You're gonna drive yourself insane
You'll never find the sunshine
When you're followin' the rain
Seems like I'd take a new road
After all these years
But I wind up on the same old trail of tears

I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin'into you

I hate the way I loved you
But my mind keeps goin' back
My train of thought just won't get off
That same old worn out track
It's an every night occasion me and your memory meet
On that endless lonely street of broken dreams

I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you

I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you
Reminiscin' through the pain recallin' things that we used to do
I'm lookin' up an old flame down on Heartbreak Avenue
I'm still walkin' down Memory Lane 'cause I know I'll be runnin' into you

Here she comes now
I'm still walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin'
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
Lord, I'm walkin'
Down Memory Lane
Oh, I'm walkin' (walkin')
Down Memory Lane
I'm still walkin' (walkin' walkin')
Down Memory Lane

It was raining hard in Houston, when I ran into her
I searched for conversation, but I was lost for words
Then a cloud of tear filled memories came crashing down on me
If it hadn't been for the pouring rain, I'm sure she would have seen

Tears in the rain, hiding the pain
Maybe she'd come back if she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain

Now I regret that moment, 'cause I didn't let her know
How much I still loved her, I was hoping it would show
But the rain drops and the tear drops ran together on my face
Now she'll never ever know, no one can take her place

Tears in the rain, hiding the pain
Maybe she'd come back if she could see me cry
She thinks I'm so strong, oh but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain

She thinks I'm so strong, but she's so wrong
She just couldn't see these tears in the rain

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

She took the TV and the toaster
She took the curtains and the car
I guess she took for granted
I wouldn't take it very hard
And for someone in a hurry
She took her own sweet time
But it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

She said I've given you my best
But I can't take no more
She said I've run out of reasons
Then she walked out the door
It's gonna take a lot of doin'
To get over her goodbye
'Cause it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

A bedroom full of memories that time cannot erase
Photographs of the two of us that she said "throw away"
She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

She took my heart and soul and left me here to lose my mind
No it's not what she took that hurt
It's what she left behind

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You've got a glow that's not a suntan
And a new gleam in your eyes
Oh it must have been one great vacation
Girl you look so satisfied

Tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in

You said you needed a small vacation
Just a couple of days all by yourself
So off you went in a new direction
And what you found was someone else

So tell me what room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in

What room was the holiday in
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in

Tell me what room was the holiday
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him
What a good time it must have been
Tell me what room was the holiday in

It looks a little weathered, so it looks good on me
But since you've left I'm wearin' this old hat differently
Pain, wind, rain and sun, it keeps out all but one

So I keep the brim pulled down
Whenever those teardrops come around
So nobody else can see
Just what your memory does to me
I know I can't hide
But baby I've still got my pride
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat

Last night, I thought I'd go out I don't know where my head was at
I had to turn around go back and get my hat
And I was glad I did when I saw you with him

I kept the brim pulled down
Whenever those teardrops came around
So nobody else could see
Just what your memory does to me
I know I can't hide
But baby I've still got my pride
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat
When your memory comes back
I keep it under my hat

Now mamma I know you've always wished me the best,
And I've found somebody and I think she's gunna pass the test.
She's a country girl as far as I can see,
Mamma I hope she's what you had in mind for me.

She likes to go skinny dipping in the heat of the day,
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay,
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss,
Mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this.

Now mamma I know she didn't grow up on a farm,
But she sure knows her way around out behind the barn,
And it ain't exactly chores she does at dawn,
But she says she's gunna love me till the cows come home.

She likes to go skinny dipping in the heat of the day,
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay,
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss,
Mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this.

She likes to go skinny dipping in the heat of the day,
And late at night she wants to roll in the hay,
She cranks my tractor with just one kiss,
Mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this,

Yeah mamma it doesn't get any countrier than this...

Bartender I may sit here on this barstool all night long
But I won't need much attention
I just need some time alone
So if you'll give me some quarters and a bottle of your best
You can just sit back and let the jukebox do the rest 

Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue" while I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

Let's start off nice and easy
Something like "If I Know Me"
And we'll work our way up slowly to "Fool Hearted Memory"
Yeah I've got all night long to sit right here and fall apart
So don't leave out one single song
I know 'em all by broken heart

Give it to me Strait
Sing "Am I Blue"
While I sit here and cry
And tell me how my baby's gotten so good at goodbye
It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

There ain't one country singer
That ain't good for a bad heartache
And for me there's nothing smoother
Than a good stiff shot of Strait

It's gonna take a fireman to put this old flame out
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound
So come on give it to me Strait
Before I come unwound

Without me
Maybe you'd find somebody else
A little wiser with a lot more wealth
And without you it's true I'd be free
To go chasing all of my dreams without any strings

But I wouldn't want it any other way
Having you to come home to
At the end of everyday
Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way

Hard times
May never let up on us
And maybe all we'll ever have
Will barely be enough
And babe you know, how cold the wind can blow
Love has never let us down
When we needed it the most

Your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
Wouldn't want it any other way (x2)

Any other way, oh girl
You know I love you more each day
Any other way, oh

Every Friday night there's a steady cloud of dust
That leads back to a field filled with pick-up trucks
Got old Hank crankin way up loud
Got coolers in the back, tailgates down
There's a big fire burnin but don't be alarmed
It's just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

Ed's been on the tractor ain't seen Becky all week
Somebody said they seen 'em headed down to the creek
Farmer Johnson's daughter's just pulled up in a Jeep
Man he knows how to grow 'em if you know what I mean
Old Dave's gettin' loud but he don't mean harm
We're just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

You can have a lotta fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

You can come as you are, there ain't no dress code
Just some rural route rules that you need to know:
Don't mess with the bull 'cause he can get real mean
Don't forget to shut the gate, stay outta the beans
If it starts to rain then we'll just head to the barn
We're country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

You can have a lotta fun in a New York minute
But there's some things you can't do inside those city limits
Ain't no closin time, ain't no cover charge
Just country boys and girls gettin' down on the farm

Let's get down y'all

Stay outta that hay

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I was standing, at the end of my rainbow
With nowhere to go, and no pot of gold in sight
All my wishes, were just way too much to hope for
But when I saw you, I knew I'd seen the light

And not a moment too soon, without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour, with my world filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon

I used to think, that love would never find me
And the one who cares, was lost somewhere in time
But when you found me, I knew I'd found forever
You rescued me, just before I crossed the line

And not a moment too soon, without a minute to spare
You touched my heart, when I didn't have a prayer
In my darkest hour, with my world filled with gloom
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon
Your sweet love saved me, not a moment too soon

Oh-oh yeah
Not a moment too soon, yeah

I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

All my friends call me Bear claw
Village chieftain is my paw paw
He gets his orders from my maw maw
She makes him walk the line

You can find me in my Wigwam
I'll be beatin' on my tom tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke ya some
Hey, and pass it around

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble, lord
Like a glass a wine

I remember the medicine man
He caught the runnin' water in my hands
Drug me around by my head band
Said I wasn't her kind

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

I can kill a Deer or Buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards don't ya know
I do it all the time

They all gather round my teepee
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my Buffalo briefs
I got 'em standin' in line

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippawa
She's a one of a kind

Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die

Last Monday morning, you left with no warning
I started going insane. Well, I headed south out of Del Rio, Texas
With a hell of a load on my brain. I kept on going
Without even knowing, how much your love really means
Now I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is pounding in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams

This picture ain't pretty
I'm ragged and dirty
And wondering what I'm doing here
Shooting tequila, wantin' to kill ya
And wishin to God you were near
So full of your memory
But feeling so empty
I've run out of my self-esteem
Now I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is pounding in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams

I'm down here in Mexico, sick as a dog
My head is pounding in this border town fog
Down to my last dime and coming apart at the seams
I messed up in Mexico, living on refried dreams

Oh, I'm stuck here in Mexico, living on refried dreams.

Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishin', when he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate, holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled, said we can't leave her behind
Son I know you don't want her to go, but someday you'll change your mind

And Johnny said
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson, take my best friend Bo
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl, ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in, front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun, grabbed her by the arm
Said if you do what I tell you to there, won't be any harm

And Johnny said
Take my money, take my wallet, take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl
But please, don't take the girl

Same old boy, same sweet girl, five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she, says it's time to go
Doctor says the baby's fine, but you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast and, Johnny hit his knees

And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me, take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me, make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God please, don't take the girl

Johnny's daddy was taking him fishin'
When he was eight years old

Well it's been a rainin' on and on
Ever since you've been gone
Those dark clouds keep a rollin' in
And every time I think I might catch myself a glimpse of sunlight
The bottom falls out again
Well I can barely keep afloat
I'm up the creek without a boat
And I've been a driftin' heaven knows how long
'Cause it's been rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Hey well drip, drip, drip
Goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any board in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms
Safe and warm
Girl it's been a long time
Since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Listen to me now
I keep staring out the window
Searching for a rainbow
To signal that the storm will end
Hey, 'Cause I know that the rain will keep pourin' on the pane
Until my saint comes back marchin' in
Oh, girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine
Baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Hey well drip, drip, drip
Goes the sound of the rain
The four winds are blowin' like a hurricane
My friends said I should settle for any board in a storm
I'd rather be inside your lovin' arms
Safe and warm
Girl it's been a long time since I've seen sunshine
But baby won't you come back home
'Cause it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone
Yeah, it's been a rainin' 40 days and a 40 nights since you've been gone

I popped the clutch on that old red Ford 
Her daddy would holler and run to the door 
Dust would fly as we flew down that old gravel driveway 
And lookin' back I can't believe he let her run with a boy like me 
He said "You better get her back by ten or there'll be hell to pay" 
I can still feel her lips on mine 
It's all so real but lost in time 

Ain't that just like a dream 
Runnin' wild and runnin' free 
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind 
Sometimes I long for just one night 
Of the way I felt back then 
But ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends 

Saturday nights we could all be found 
Radios up and our windows rolled down 
Hearts on fire and holdin' hands sights set on forever 
We never thought those days would end we'd never be the same again 
Summer would be the last time we would ever be together 
I never knew I'd wake up some day 
In a brand new world so far away 

Ain't that just like a dream 
Runnin' wild and runnin' free 
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind 
Sometimes I long for just one night 
Of the way I felt back then 
But ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends 
Sometimes I long for just one night 
Of the way I felt back then 
But ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends 
Ain't that just like a dream 
It always ends

I just want to get a little more out of my payday
Finally own a car that doesn't break down on the freeway
A little vacation
Ain't asking very much
I hate comin' home to this old broken down apartment
I wish I had a dime for every hole that's in the carpet
I don't want it all
But I ain't got enough

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

I don't mind the hours and the pain that comes from workin'
But it's enough to kill me when I see my baby hurtin'
Wanna give her that diamond I never got to buy
She keeps tellin' me that everything is gettin' better
But one step up the rung and someone knocks me off the ladder

Just wanna break even
Someday before I die

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

All I want is a life
To drink from a glass from a well that ain't dry
I'm sick of the crumbs I want a piece of that pie
All I want is a life

All I want
Is a life
All I want
Is a life

Every where I go,
They're starin' at her,
Every man I know.
He wants to have her
I guess I outta be a jealous man.

I look the other way
They're hittin' on her every night and day
They telephone her
They try and get to her
But I know they can't

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart.

She walks into the room
And everybody watches every move
Hopin' she don't love me
I know it by the way
They hang around.
But they don't realize
There's more to her than what meets eye
That's why I'm certain
That no matter what they do
To reach her now

'Cause she never lets it go to her heart
She never lets it go that far
When they start talkin'
She starts walkin'
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
But she never lets it go to her heart.

She never lets it go to her heart

(Repeat chorus until fades)

Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in Mexico
It blocked the wind-it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So, she can't be really gone

The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waiting in the hall
For her to slip them on
So, she can't be really gone

I don't know when she'll come back
She must intend to come back
I've seen the error of my ways
Don't waste the tears on me
What more proof do you need
Just look around the room
So much of her remains

Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now, who could ever walk away
At chapter twenty-one
So, she can't be really gone

Just look around the room
So much of her remains

Her book is lying on the bed
The two of hearts to mark her page
Now, who could ever walk away
With so much left undone
So, she can't be really gone

No, she can't be really gone

I got an empty feelin' when that moving van pulled up
It got a whole lot emptier as I watched them fill that truck
And when they carried out your clothes it took my breath away
Now they're headed for that bed
The thought keeps runnin' though my head

Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight

I'll pay them boys to stop right now
And leave that truck out on the curb
The TV and the phone's packed up
So we won't be disturbed

There's not a light left in this room
Just a shadow of a doubt
So let's make sure we don't give up
Before we've thought this through enough

Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight

Baby, maybe, we should just sleep on it tonight
And give our hearts just one more chance to change our minds
I could be wrong but goodbye, just don't feel right
So baby, maybe, baby, maybe, baby, maybe
We should just sleep on it tonight

Fogged in in Dallas
On my way to L.A.
Staring up at the screen,
All flights were delayed.
When a voice from behind me
Asked "Stranger how have you been?"
Well I was caught off guard,
When I saw her face
Stumbled my way through an awkward embrace
Then somehow I managed to say
"Good to see you again."
We caught up on old friends,
Caught up on old times
But all through the small talk,
It kept burnin through my mind

Does she think about the nights we spent on Crystal Lake?
Wrapped up in a blanket till the break of day
So many times I've wondered
Does she, think of me that way?
I didn't ask
And she didn't say

Tradin stories and pictures of kids
Things we're gonna do and things we never did
Till stranded in that moment
Not sure what to say
Then she broke the silence
With her little shy smile
She brought up the weather,

But all the while I wondered
If she thinks about Jackson Hole
Nights beside the fire and angels in the snow
So many times I've wondered
Does she think of me that way?
I didn't ask and she didn't say

We said our goodbyes
Swore we'd stay in touch
Then we went our separate ways
Knowing no one ever does

But I couldn't help but wonder
As I walked away
If things had turned out different
Where would we be today
So many times I've wondered
Does she think of me that way?
I didn't ask and she didn't say
No I didn't ask and she didn't say

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Maybe I go too fast, too far
Let's get it straight now the way things are
I'm not the white knight in your fantasy
I could be your wildest dream

I might ride with the wind
I might follow the sun
And I gotta go where I've never been
'Cause my heart beats to a different drum
It's just the way I was made
I'm a renegade, I'm a renegade

I get this feeling that I should be gone
But something keeps telling me to take you alone
I got a Chevy with a big back seat
Climb on in and and take a chance on me

Don't even think about settlin' down
Ain't gonna hang my hat in no one town

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep

But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

My mamma and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in till that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

I gotta wash my truck
And dress up
Pick her up to watch TV
When she sits down on the sofa
She'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
I don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

Come on, baby
You know what I like

Yeah, I like that

Hey! Don't forget to turn out the lights!

She was reading a book that she'd already read just to pass the time
He just sat there and stared at the TV set like he was barely alive
When the local news was over they would climb the stairs
Crawl in bed underneath the covers like neither one was there

And it's a long long way across the Great Divide
The songs that they once sang now echo far and wide
They could still get back all the love that they have lost
But only if they both will reach across
'Cause it's a long long way to the other side of the Great Divide

He was up in the attic on the Fourth of July as they flew a flag in the yard
When he found some roses she had long ago dried before they drifted apart
How the years had slipped right by them he didn't understand
He carried a petal into the kitchen and he placed it in her hand

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Your eyes say that you've been hurt before
And you can't take the heartache anymore
You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby, this is me you're talking to

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man

I know you think that love will never last
And you see your future like the past
You don't wanna make the same mistake
You think that I'm one more to make
But baby, I'm not him for goodness sake

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man

You think I'll do what he's done to you
Break your trust and be untrue
But baby, this is me you're talking to

You got the wrong man, it's not me
A case of mistaken identity
I didn't break your heart, you see
What can I do to make you understand?
You got the wrong man

It's not me, no
You got the wrong man

Mister can you take me into Little Rock
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck
I'll listen all night if you wanna talk
Just don't mention Memphis

And we can talk about your family
Politics, music, and philosophy
Any old subject's all right with me
Just don't mention Memphis

Or blue eyes and light brown hair
An angel wavin' to me from the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did was leave her standin' there
So don't mention Memphis

Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup
We'll make Texas with a little luck
And I'm hangin' with ya till the sun comes up
So don't mention Memphis

Or blue eyes and light brown hair
An angel wavin' to me from the top of the stairs
The hardest thing I did was leave her standin' there
So don't mention Memphis
I don't wanna talk about Memphis

And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there
So don't mention Memphis
I don't wanna talk about Memphis

I rolled my Daddy's truck off the Dicksonville curve
After drinkin' my fifth beer
And I fed hogs tryin' to pay him off
For most of my senior year

I got my jaw jacked by a big ol' boy
For messing 'round with his girlfriend
She was tall and tight and she kissed just right
But I'll never do that again

Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

I've been kicked in the face by a horse
'Cause I ran up too fast behind him
And I shook hands on a deal with a man
And found out he was lyin'

I've broken a couple of good girl's hearts
'Cause I've said I loved 'em knowin' I couldn't
And I've given my heart to a woman
Who said she'd stay when I knew she wouldn't

Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

I've been bit I've been burned but I've lived and I've learned from it
I've made some mistakes but that's what it takes
To make a man out of a kid

Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

Yeah I've done some pretty stupid things but hey
I'm a little bit harder and
A whole lot smarter
That's how I got to be this way

A lot of people called it prison when I was growin' up
But these are my roots and this is what I love
Cause everybody knows me and I know them
And I believe that's the way we were supposed to live
Wouldn't trade one single day here in small town USA

Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
A little Hank Jr. and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that's full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA

Around here we break our backs just to earn a buck
We never get ahead but we have enough
I watch people leave and then come right back
I never wanted any part of that
I'm proud to say that I love this place
Good ole small town USA

Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
David Allen Coe and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Here in small town USA
Oh yeah

I wouldn't trade one single day
I'm proud to say I love this place

Give me a Saturday night my baby by my side
Sweet home Alabama and a six pack of light
Old dirt road and I'll be just fine
Give me a Sunday morning that full of grace
A simple life and I'll be okay
Yeah I'll be okay

But now your here with me
Staring up, at a summer sky
A blanket in the truck bed
Just give me the go ahead
'Cause baby we got plenty of time

Crickets are singing
Country moon is shinning
I can see the fire burning in your eyes
All I wanna do, is lay you down and love you
Like there's no tomorrow, tonight

Let me whisper in your ear
Make my intentions clear
We'll just be getting started come midnight
Get in a rhythm, nobody's near listening
Just you and me for miles and miles

Crickets are singing
Country moon is shinning
I can see the fire burnin in your eyes
All I wanna do, is lay you down and love you
Like there's no tomorrow, tonight

Wear my name on the back of my belt
Believe there's a God to save me from hell
And dirt roads were made for country boys like me
Don't believe in politically correct
You wanna a piece better have a set
A rifle and a four wheel drive is all I need
Small mouth bass on the end of a hook
Daddy read from the good book

I'm just a country boy from this land
Makin' a living with these two hands
Still believe in the good ole American way
I watch 'em shut the factories down
Then the foreigners flood into town
They take what's left for half the pay
We can't stand by and just let it fade away
The good ole American way

Got sense enough to know things change
But the little man's getting screwed today
Somebody with a backbone please stand up
Oh we worked so hard to get this far
Now we're forgetting everything and just call it love
Don't tell me there ain't somethin' wrong
Somebody's gotta sing this song

I'm just a country boy from this land
Makin' a living with these two hands
Still believe in the good ole American way
I watch 'em shut the factories down
Then the foreigners flood into town
They take what's left for half the pay
We can't stand by and just let it fade away
The good ole American way

We can't stand by and just let it fade away

Believe there's a God to save me from hell

Tried to steal my girl
Better bring your big friends

To be calling me names
I'm bout to knock that smirky little grin
Right off of your face

Don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt ya

I know you ain't never milked a cow before
You ain't never slung hay from a second floor barn door
You never heard of Daisy or of Elly May, well that's okay, we got all day

But them pigtails and cutoffs work on you
You gonna learn to love this kinda life
You're gonna fit right in, now shut up and drive and

Well I was baptized at the Baptist church
And my old man taught me 'bout a hard day's work
I learned how to love, learned how to fight
It's where we keep our cash in a dresser drawer
Underneath the forty-four
And if we do you wrong we damn sure make it right

It's the only place that I call home
No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home

Your word is good on a handshake
Preacher still talks about a judgment day
People gonna stop when a funeral passes by
We say "yes sir" and say "yes ma'am"
Answer the call from Uncle Sam
Hit a bully in the nose if he crosses the line

It's the only place that I call home
No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home

My roots are buried deep here in this little town
And one of these days it's where they'll put me in the ground

It's the only place that I call home
No matter where in this country I might roam
It's where the corn grows tall and the moonshine still flows
It's the only place that I call home

You stood on that bank when I got baptized,
Gave me a 30-30 when I turned 9.
At 16 you caught me drinkin' out in the barn.
I could hear you cheerin' when we won state, and you held my hand at Grandma's grave.
And I'll always be thankful, that you never sold the farm.

Grandpa, you stood so tall,
Chewed that Red Man wore overalls.
You were the same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night.
You were five foot six to the top of your hat but, when you talked about the war I thought you were superman.
American born simple man with a southern drawl.
You walk the walk, talk the talk, Grandpa.

You still swear Roosevelt was the best.
That a home grown tomater tastes better than the rest and, fifty years goes too fast with a woman you love.
Well this life I've chose is gettin' busy now and when I walk up on your front porch;
It's just like I'm still young.

Grandpa, you stood so tall,
Chewed that Red Man wore overalls.
You were the same man on Sunday morning as Saturday night.
You were five foot six to the top of your hat but, when you talked about the war I thought you were superman.
American born simple man with a southern drawl.
You walk the walk, talk the talk, Grandpa.

Yeah, American born a dirt road man with that slow southern drawl.

A lot of things a country boy learns in life
How to shoot a gun and how to use a knife
But when I pulled into Hershey, PA
I took my guitar up on the big stage.

That night I did the best I could
Me and the boys played pretty darn good
Then I took myself out, sat in the crowd;
And learned how Bocephus shakes 'em down

You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
If you wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it
If you ain't got a boat, you gotta bank it
Live it just like he sings it
You gotta Hank it

There was a smokin' little blonde sittin' next to me
Said how'd you make it here from Tennessee
She must've been late and didn't catch my show
But when you play at 7 that's the way it goes
So I tipped my hat and we sang along to Where Have All My Rowdy Friends Gone
I climbed up on the bus after the show
Had a shot of Jim Beam and we hit the road.

You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
You wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it
Ain't got a boat, gotta bank it
Live it just like he sings it
You gotta Hank it

You gotta Hank it
You can't sip whiskey, gotta drink it
Push it up to ten and crank it
You wanna keep your woman, gotta spank it

She takes me to a party
Dressed up in city clothes
Pretending I'm somebody
Everybody oughta know
But once I get a cold beer in my hand
There ain't no mistaken who I am

I can't hide my redneck side
Its in my blood till the day I die
When I start having a real good time
Oh I can't hide my redneck side

Went to meet her family
For a weekend in the sun
A big house on the ocean
Yeah we were really havin' fun
Till they cought me in the pool at 2am
Wearin nothin' but a farmers tan

I can't hide my redneck side
Its in my blood till the day I die
When I start having a real good time
Oh I can't hide my redneck side

I like guitars in my music
Muscle in my cars
And I like girls that hang out at bars
No one can change the way they are

And I can't hide my redneck side
Its in my blood till the day I die
When I start having a real good time
No I can't hide my redneck side
No I can't hide my redneck side

She likes an ice cold Bud pressed against her hand
Standing on the porch looking 'cross our land
Seeing the bass hit that top water
And that was my kind of woman first time I saw her.

Yeah she looks good on my tractor, good on my truck
Good on my bed when the sun comes up
She's good with a cane pole, good with a gun
It's corn bread and sweet tea where she's from
She's my kind of woman, good as they come.

She'd rather be on a lake than in a mall,
In a duck blind at daylight blowin' my call,
She likes to get hogwild in the middle of the day,
My kind of woman likes to roll in the hay,

Yeah she looks good on my tractor, good on my truck
Good on my bed when the sun comes up
She's good with a cane pole, good with a gun
It's corn bread and sweet tea where she's from
She's my kind of woman, good as they come.

Yeah she looks good on my tractor, good on my truck
Good on my bed when the sun comes up
She's good with a Zepco, good with a gun
It's corn bread and sweet tea where she's from

Every day I drive to work across Flint River bridge
A hundred yards from the spot where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand on the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peelin' peaches if it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd hug all three of those girls we lost from the class of '99

And I'd find my bird dog Bo and take him huntin' one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of "Me and Bobby McGee"
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away

Midnight in Albuquerque
Drunk again on a little Wild Turkey
Damned if her memory didn't show up right on time
I've driven through the rain, the snow and ice
I ain't hit the same town twice
Just lookin' for a place I figured she couldn't find

I thought by now she'd left me alone
Turned around and headed back home
And just let me be
Hell what does she want with me

Bartender set 'em up
Hell as long as she's here might as well stay drunk
Start fresh tomorrow somewhere down the road
Shut down another bar
Try to convince my heart somehow sometime some place
This is gonna work
Oh but what if I run out of honky tonks
Before I get over her

Well she walked out and I bought a map
A couple towns and I'd be back
Some place I could hurt where no one knew my name
Yeah I started out in Little Rock
I've lost track of everywhere I stopped
I can't seem to drink enough to outrun the pain

You'd think by now her memory
Would get tired of following me
But tonight ain't the night
So before they turn out the lights

Bartender set 'em up
Hell as long as she's here might as well stay drunk
Start fresh tomorrow somewhere down the road
Shut down another bar
Try to convince my heart somehow sometime some place
This is gonna work
Oh but what if I run out of honky tonks
Before I get over her

Shut down another bar
Try to convince my heart somehow sometime some place
This is gonna work
Oh but what if I run out of honky tonks
Before I get over her
'Fore I get over her

Bird dog just had her puppies that's a hundred dollars cash apiece
This old boy struck it country rich
At least for a couple of weeks
I owe my daddy that 50 spot
And the muffler shop the rest
But daddy and bubba's gonna have to waiibe got an empty ice chest

Boys it's beer time
This ol' town's dry
Headed to the county line
For something cold
I need a twelve pack in a brown paper sack
Ice it down in the back
Find a deep mud hole
I got my baby and some rowdy friends of mine
It's beer time

I heard bocephus was coming to town and I still had a little cash
I bought me a couple of nose bleed tickets
Way up in the back
It chilled me to the bone when he sang got
A shotgun rifle and a four wheel drive
Crowd went crazy and I told my baby
It was worth every dime

Now it's beer time
Hearin' Hank play live country boy can survive
I need something cold
When the show ends party with my rowdy friends
Hell of a weekend
I ain't ready to go
Crack another top beneath the parking lot lights
It's beer time

Boys it's beer time
This ol' town's dry
Headed to the county line
For something cold
I need a twelve pack in a brown paper sack
Ice it down in the back
Find a deep mud hole

It's 5 o'clock Friday afternoon
And it's beer time
Yeah the fish are biting in a honey hole

I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, 'cause he's into bein' green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eatin' that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love, sounds like it sucks...

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line, but not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook.

Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so...

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line, but not the kind in a field and stream book
No darlin' I ain't even worried, you'll come runnin' back
He can't even bait a hook.

It won't be that long, till you start gettin' bored
I'll be smilin' on the river, realin' in one more...

He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
Hell he don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line, but not the kind in a field and stream book

No baby I ain't even worried

I've been on the Grand Ole Opry
I've played a show with ZZ Top
Went on tour with Skynyrd and man they still rock
Shot the bull with Bocephus, before he climbed up on his jet
Played south Florida with Alan Jackson
That's some things that you never forget
And all that stuff it makes you feel real good
But not near as good...

As flyin' down a back road
With some buddies from back home
A splash of Jack in my Coke
Catchin' brim on a Zebco
Spottin' deer in a hay field
After church a Sunday meal
Huggin' mama before I go
Flyin' down a back road

Up there in Des Moines, they knew my songs line by line
I just stood there in the fake smoke
Another dream came true that night
I've seen so many places, I thought I'd never see
All the way from California to as far as you can go East
And all that stuff it makes you feel real good,
But not near as good...

As flyin' down a back road
With some buddies from back home
A splash of Jack in my Coke
Catchin' brim on a Zebco
Spottin' deer in a hay field
After church a Sunday meal
And huggin' mama before I go
Yeah, flyin' down a back road

I'm a lucky man, I got a real good life
With all the things I've done nothin' gets me as high...

Stand in the back and cover your ears
Go sit in your car, till the show is over

Brother maybe you're in the wrong place,
If you don't like a rowdy crowd
We're about to get drunk, and go country on ya
Yeah, it's gonna get loud

No I don't care if you don't like my twang
'Cause I know they love it in small town USA
It's the way I live, it's the way I talk
Hell yeah, it's the way I sing
So I don't care if you don't like my twang

I've been singin' and playin' this guitar
Since I was twelve years old
It took me from a porch, to the Opry, to the radio,
To a whole lot of records sold
Well we must be doin' somethin' right,
'Cause we packed it out again
So don't let the door hit you in the ass,
And you can tell all your friends

No I don't care if you don't like my twang
'Cause I know they love it in small town USA
It's the way I live, it's the way I talk
Hell yeah, it's the way I sing
So I don't care if you don't like my twang

I don't care if you don't like my twang
'Cause I know they love it down in small town USA
It's the way I live, it's the way I talk
Hell yeah, it's the way I sing
So I don't care if you don't like my twang
Said no, I don't care if you don't like my twang

I started out with a .410, then moved to a .20 gauge.
Every squirrel and rabbit in Dallas county knew my name.
I sat on the stand with PawPaw from the time I was three years old.
When I was eight I used a muzzle loader to kill my first doe.
These days I go down to Wal-Mart and they set 'em in the back.
Some people wanna take 'em away, why don't you go bust them boys that sellin' crack.

Guns, whether Remingtons and Glocks. 
Come on man it ain't like I'm a slingin' 'em on the block. 
I'm gunna tell you once and listen son.
As long as I'm alive and breathing, 
You wont take my guns. 

If there ever was a time we need 'em, 
I'd say it be today. 
When we're letting them terrorists watch cable TV and walk out of Guantanamo Bay. 
I just try to do the right thing and raise my family in this land. 
Treating me like you want to be treated and that's what I call a man.
If we don't have 'em, what do we do. Tell me where we gunna go.
Somebody breaks into my house, I'm gunna need my Colt .44.

Guns, whether Remingtons and Glocks.
Come on man it, ain't like I'm a slingin' 'em on the block. 
I'm gunna tell you once and listen son.
As long as I'm alive and breathing, 
You wont take my guns.

Listen.

Guns. Whether Remingtons or Glocks.
Come on man, it ain't like I'm a slingin' 'em on the block.
I'm gunna tell once and listen son.
As long as I'm alive and breathing, 
And I'm still breathing, 
You wont take my guns. 

No, you can take 'em from me when you take 'em from my grandpa and my daddy.

Down in Alabama they wear them little cutoffs,
In Georgia it's camo bikini tops,
South Carolina layin' on the Myrtle Beach,
Panama City drinkin' shots for free
That time I went out to California, had to dodge them on the PCH,
And over there in Little Rock sunnin' on the bass boat,
Sippin' on a cold one out on the lake

Them sunshine babies
All across the land workin' on a tan
Drivin' country boys crazy
All oiled down with a beer in their hand
Easy to spot, way too hot
I'm diggin' on what they got
Them sunshine babies

Hat turned backwards, flyin' down a back road
CJ 7, headed for the swimmin' hole
Me and the boys, hangin' out of the doors
Ain't got no fishin' pole, got no lures
'Cause what we're after's layin' up on the bank
They're jumpin' off that old rope swing
Barefoot in the mud, cooler on the tailgate
I can see 'em now, shakin' their thing

Them sunshine babies
All across the land workin' on a tan
Drivin' country boys crazy
All oiled down with a beer in their hand
Easy to spot, way too hot
I'm diggin' on what they got
Them sunshine babies

People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, tryin' to love me
Yeah, I'll wreck your world

I can see why they're all talkin'
Lookin' back at my past
I've got a bad name, but a man can change
I'm livin' proof of that

Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you

Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you

Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest,
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around,
And baby don't you ever forget

Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Darlin' yes I will

Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
All the way up, till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be lovin' you
Oh babe, till my last day

We can pop a top on a bottle of Boone's.
Have a front row seat to a big full moon.
Kick back and listen to the crickets in the field.
Find a star we can call our own
Watch the lightning bugs 'til they're gone.
Light a fire of passion or lay real still.

In the bed of my Chevy on the outskirts of town,
We can dance standing up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you, if you let me
Make a memory we'll never forget
Whisper little words I've never said
I'll pull you close when it gets hot and heavy
In the bed of my Chevy.

Baby slide off your boots down to your bare feet.
Those cut offs and tan lines are killin' me.
Move on over, lay your head on my shoulder, we'll stay a while.
Steal a little kiss as the whip-poor-will's,
Sing through the trees with a southern feel.
We can sit on the tailgate and wait till it feels right.

In the bed of my Chevy on the outskirts of town,
We can dance standing up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you, if you let me
Make a memory we'll never forget
Whisper little words I've never said
I'll pull you close when it gets hot and heavy
In the bed of my Chevy.

In the bed of my Chevy on the outskirts of town,
We can dance standing up or lay a blanket down
I can show you how much I love you, if you let me

I've been a rough houser, a good time sleep arounder
A straight up whiskey pounder, till I don't know my name
I've been a church goer, a front pew bible holder
A cry on my momma's shoulder when she saw me change
But each day's a choice, which one I'm gonna be...
God bless outlaws like me

I curse the sun, I pray for rain
I've run a mile to walk through pain
I've seen the worst and I've seen the best that I could be
God bless outlaws like me

I've been an SOB'er, a night time bar room leaner
A go back and forth betweener, and that's the truth
And I've been a come home early, get to my girl in a hurry
At night so she didn't worry, I even said I love you
But each day's days a choice, to love her or livin' free...
God bless outlaws like me

I curse the sun, I pray for rain
I've run a mile to walk through pain
I've seen the worst and I've seen the best that I could be

What's wrong with sayin' yes sir, sayin' yes ma'am, a hard day's work
Showin' up pretty much on time
What's wrong with waitin' your turn, payin' your dues, keepin' your word
And lookin' a man right in the eye
You can wear your pants down around your knees
But that don't mean a dang to me

Just put a little old back in the new school
Get that workin' man back on the bar stool
Just 'cause somethin's hip don't make it cool
Let's put a little old back in the new school

I don't mind some attitude, a rebel heart, hell I got one too
But you still gotta walk the line
I don't care what you listen to, how you wear your hair you can paint it blue
Hey, it takes all kinds
Johnny rocked and Willie rolled, they just did it with a whole lot more soul

Just put a little old back in the new school
Get that workin' man back on the bar stool
Just 'cause somethin's hip don't make it cool
Let's put a little old back in the new school

My grandpa just turned 83
I hope some of him rubbed off on me
He's still cooler than I'll ever be

Just put a little old back in the new school
(Yeah) Get that workin' man back on the bar stool
Just 'cause somethin's hip don't make it cool
Let's put a little old back in the new school

Yeah I might be young but I ain't no fool
Come on, let's put a little old back in the new school
Yeah, new school
Put some old back in it

That water tower's got the sun goin' down behind it. 
If there's a good time in this town, girl, we're gonna find it. 
You look so damn good climbin' up in my Chevy 
Tryin' to play it cool but I knew already 
By the way you looked in the dashboard lights 
It was gonna be one of those nights. 

Got the Kenwoods bangin' that rock 'n' roll. 
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go? 
I can ride ya 'round town or drive ya down some old back road. 
I love the way ya lean that seat back, 
Steal my ball cap, pull it down over your blue eyes 
Watchin' your hair fly out the window 
Lettin' the night roll 
And I can't wait to see where it goes. 

We can run the reds down Main Street dodgin' the blue lights 
Or disappear out into the corn out past the county line 
Baby keep on, keep on swayin' to the back beat 
Long as you're right here, right here beside me 
You make the call, baby I don't care 
We can take this anywhere. 

Got the Kenwoods bangin' that rock 'n' roll. 
Whisper to me baby, where you wanna go? 
I can ride ya 'round town or drive ya down some old back road. 
I love the way ya lean that seat back, 
Steal my ball cap, pull it down over your blue eyes 
Watchin' your hair fly out the window

I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart
I wake up and I make two black cups of coffee
The routine being with you taught me left its mark
These old, old habits die hard

I get in the car and turn the radio on
Expecting you to sing along but you never start
It's a lonely road and I can't see where it ends
Where I'm goin' and where we've been are so far apart
These old, old habits die hard

I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
'Cause old, old habits die hard

These four walls are slowly closing in around me
Without your light I'm here drowning in the dark
I pick up the phone then I come straight to my senses
I know the consequences of going that far
Old, old habits die hard

I said goodbye when you let go
Still I hold on to all I've known
Wherever I am there you are
These old, old habits die hard

I say goodnight to an empty space beside me
The only reply is the beat of my heart

I've always been one of them boys 
Rollin' around in jacked up toys 
Making noise on small town Friday nights 

Red light running, good time chasing, 
Guess I've earned this reputation 
Probably never shake it but that's alright 

I've got a rough side, a wild side 
At least a country mile wide 
A fightin' side after a few 
If they wanna see my sweet side 
My soft side, my best side 
I just point at you 
Yea, point at you 

Girl I ain't sure just what it is 
That's got me all tore up like this 
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone 

I still like to get a little crazy 
But something about your loving baby 
It breaks me down and makes me wanna haul ass home 

I've got a rough side, a wild side 
At least a country mile wide 
A fightin' side after a few 
If they wanna see my sweet side 
My soft side, my best side 
I just point at you 
Point at you yeah 

Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me 
Lord knows I'm hard to hold 
But I guess you kinda like all of my sides 
And I ain't letting you go 
Cause my best side is holding me close 
Point at you, yeah 

I've got a rough side, a wild side 
At least a country mile wide 
A fightin' side after a few 
If they wanna see my sweet side 
My soft side, my best side

Oh baby, I just point at you

Oh babe my best side is you

You're shaking it low at a country show
Everybody's saying whoa whoa

Might be a bullshitter
But I ain't no ass kisser
'Least I've never been one before
But if there's anybody's ass I'd kiss
I'd want it to be yours, whoa, whoa, whoa

Hate to see you go but I love to watch you leave girl,
Those Daisy Dukes and boots are rockin' my world
Even Snoop D.O. Double G would be jealous of me in this Chevy
When you're on this bench seat
'Cause girl your booty's

Make me wanna take a bite when you dirty dance

In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever
But then again, they don't really leave
'Cause deep down inside of me I know Heaven's gotta be
This kind of town

In this kind of town we know how to fix it
We know how to make it, we know how to mix it
Friday night lasts all weekend long
We crank it up loud and sing a little song about
This kind of town

We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in
This kind of town
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

In this kind of town there's peanuts in a bottle
The old men ramble at the brand new McDonald's
Talk about the war and the football team
Saying Lordy me I never thought I'd live to see this kind of town

We work hard, play hard
Take our paychecks straight to the Walmart
Girls will out drank you
Boys will out Hank you
Tie a yellow ribbon on a tree to say thank you
Sunday morning rolls around
We walk up the aisle and kneel down
We look around at all we've been given
And we thank God to be living in

No it ain't everything but let me tell you, it's everything

In this kind of town people stay together
Nobody leaves unless they leave forever

Tailgate down we got some good jams
Summertime just got a little hotter
Your toes tappin' along in the water

Crank it on up
Pour a little in your cup

Slide on over
Get a little closer

We'll keep the key turned back to accessory
Turned on the way you're turning me
On in the glow of the dashboard
Let's get to rockin' this 4x4

Saturday night my first high school dance
Showin up late in my sundays best
Seen you before ah but not in that dress
The DJ's last song and I lost the dare
So with my heart and my pride on the line
I asked you to dance for our first time right there
Holding hands in the hall
All night wait for your call its 2 am and were still on the phone
Hanging out at the mall oh that old picture show
I reach for your lips girl first taste of love
That old ford truck was your daddy's worst fear
Oh I remember the way love felt in freshman year
Graduated in may we went our separate ways
Till the hole in my heart was too much to take
You made that drive down to my dorm room that night
Every knock at the door you go and hide
And I thought I'd drown in the tears that you cried
Just a holdin' on tight
We found a way to relight that old fire that night
We were young and wild hanging out to late at night at all those college bars cheap natty light
Just like one of the guys you stuck right by my side at every football game there with a smile
Two in the crowd screaming go dawgs go
Oh I remember the way love felt in freshman year
Oh we're still young and wild hanging out to late at night in all these college bars cheap natty light

Grand daddy used to take me
Down town to the kinneys
That's where all the old men go to reminisce
Ramble on about history dust off some old stories
Look back at the life they've come to miss
I swear sometimes I can almost see
A picture of this small town back in 1943
Everything's black and white
And there's dirt on the street
It don't look at all what I'm seein' today

Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
Waving "hi" to everyone around
It's in my blood it's where I settle down
Lay me in the ground under what's left of a small town

You can still get a hair cut for less than ten bucks
If you go down to buds right off the square
It's been almost 10 years since they closed down that old mill
That's what this whole town was built around
There's a couple old dirt roads
Left down by old potts' farm
We used to throw down hard out there man we never did no harm
Well the counties offered thousands, man that old Potts won't give in
There development stops right at that barbed wire fence

Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
Waving "hi" to everyone around
It's in my blood it's where I settle down
Lay me in the ground under what's left of a small town

Riding around
What's left of a small town
Makin' my rounds
Waving "hi" to everyone around

I had a buddy come down 'round last July
Called me when he crossed the Mason-Dixon Line
Said he was headed down south and looking for a real good time.

I said, "Man, come on, I got a place in mind."
We pulled up at bar right off the Georgia line.
Walked in, man, his eyes got wide
And when his jaw hit the floor, all I could do was smile.

He said, "Man, we got some pretty women up north
But I ain't never seen nothing like this."
I said, "Man, these here ain't ordinary women.
We call these grits."

She's a product of being raised in the country.
She knows her roots and works hard for her money.
A southern drawl with dark tan legs.
Ain't nothin' like a woman southern born and bred.
Now she loves her mama, daddy, and the Lord to death.
Acting innocent and playing hard to get
With her girls tonight, man, they're out on the town.
Grits, man - a girl raised in the south.

Sat down at the bar had a couple drinks.
Breakin' his neck just scoping the scene.
It wasn't long before he had my attention pointed towards the door.

He was starin' at long legs that ran into boots.
Her short skirt and her t-shirt didn't have much use
But she walked right to the jukebox and fired it up.

She had every head turning, boys eyes was burning
As she made her way out to the floor.
Had all the jealous girls looking, all saying,
"She ain't nothin' but a..."
Oh my God, she just broke it down low.

Product of being raised in the country.
She knows her roots and works hard for her money.
A southern drawl with dark tan legs.
Ain't nothin' like a woman southern born and bred.
Now she loves her mama, daddy, and the Lord to death.
Good at acting innocent and playing hard to get
With her girls tonight, man, they're out on the town.
Grits, man - a girl raised in the south.

She comes home late at night
Kicks her high heels off and sighs
And lays down on the bed
She said it's been a long day at work
I couldn't wait till I got home
To be with you again
Lord I love just to watch her sleeping
Ya I just pull the covers up
And wonder what she's dreamin'...

Well she's wrapped up
With a T-shirt on
Got the lights turned way down low
Radios got her favorite song
And she's singin' right along
Oh
Let your hair down, baby let it fall
Rip the phone cord out the wall
Whisper I love you while your driftin off again
Whenever we're alone

Took her out last Friday night
Let her dance under neon light
And that girl she's turnin' heads
Strangers eyes right on my girl
Can't blame him man she's beautiful
She's comin' home with me
And Lord her beauty is hard to hide
I'm countin' my blessin every night

Well she's wrapped up

I found box of memories, read a letter dropped tear where you signed your name, turnin' the page, smearin' the ink in love always, girl I always start this way, then I end up in a bottle screamin' out you name, punchin' the walls carryin' on like I've gone insane, and in the mirror I can see the man who just shook his head with no remorse, watchin' an angel cry tears as she stepped over my beers headed out the door.

There ain't nothin' like a memory, when its comin' on strong like a hurricane, how could love like that just up and walk away, killin' me baby, its got me pourin' up another drink, burboun's hittin' me hard like a freight train, with my back against the wall or on my knees, when worst of your memory gets the best of me.

Well I remember it all too well, ridin' 441 down to Milledgeville, crossin' the bridge as the sun set on Lake Sinclair, I couldn't wait to see your smile, but all I saw was tears in your pretty eyes, and that said it all, it was all downhill from there, and I remember you sayin' baby please don't give up on me, but this stubborn man is gonna line the bed he made,

There ain't nothin' like a memory, when its comin' on strong like a hurricane, how could love like that just up and walk away, its killin' me baby, its got me pourin' up another drink, burboun's hittin' me hard like a freight train, with my back against the wall or on my knees, when worst of your memory gets the best, the best of me

Yeah, I worked all week,
Cleaned up, clean cut and clean shaved.
Get the cover off the '68,
Fire it up let them horses sing,
A little pretty thing, a little tan-legged georgia dream,
She's a rockin' them holey jeans.
Baby, what you got goin' on Saturday,
You know, words got it, there's gonna be a party, outta town bout half a mile.
Four wheel drives and big mud tires,
Muscadine wine.

Oh you can find me in back of a ford truck tailgate,
Sittin' round watchin all these pretty things gettin' down in that georgia clay,
And I'll find peace in the bottom of a real tall cold drink,
Chillin' to skynyrd and some old hank.
Let's get this thing started it's my kind of party.

Girl if your gonna drink,
Go baby just do your thing,
Give up *your* keys.
Well hell why drive when you can stay with me.
And after while we'll sneak away from the bon-fire, walk by the moon-light and down to the river side,
Got you sippin on the moonshine.

Baby if you're in the mood,
We can settle for a one night rodeo,
If you can be my tan-legged juliet,
I'll be your redneck romeo. oh baby

Where y'all goin'?
We still got a keg breathin.

I set out one night in the fast lane bound for freedom
In a truck that daddy bought me
And money mom had saved for school

I laid down all my books and picked up the drinking
Hell I let 'em down
When I gave up like a fool

And one reckless night just lookin' for my whiskey
I found a bible mama gave me and read a while
I read a story 'bout a man who lived just like me
Then finally ate his pride and came runnin' home

And lord I'm a renegade, a rambler
I've squandered all I've owned
A bonified runaway, I'm a gambler
Can't count the lies I've told
And I need redemption, how 'bout forgiveness
And I pray for open arms, and be with me lord
'Cause I'm comin' home, like a modern day prodigal son

I had all of my things packed by early mornin'
I left that bottle I'd lost right there on the bathroom floor
I stopped at a payphone and called back home to mama
Yeah she might not even talk after all I've done

The phone rang twice before I got an answer
And mama nearly dropped the phone when she heard me say
I said mama it's your son and will y'all have me
She said son you know I've longed for this day

-Chorus Again 2x-

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's all around town
Here's ten cents for mistakes he's made
It's all word of mouth
Oh but they say that's the price you pay
When you're in with the wrong crowd
Oh look at the mess you've made
Starring you down, every time you show your face

Ah to hell with all the small town small talk I've had enough
It ain't their place to judge
Man I'm giving up
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man 
The worlds going to turn, ain't going to stop you
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
Ain't nothing they can do
Hell live it up

She's made up her mind
This mistakes going to have a name
She's in for the nine
Awe but she just turned 18
It's a matter of time
Before she hits these streets
You say it ain't right
Aw but she don't wear no ring

Ah to hell with all the small town small talk I've had enough
It ain't their place to judge

Man I'm giving up
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man 
The worlds going to turn, ain't going to stop you
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
Ain't nothing they can do
Hell live it up

So let the sinless man, cast the first stone
And may the judgment in my life, belong to God alone


And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
You live and you learn man 
The worlds going to turn, ain't going to stop you
And I said if you can't live it down
Might as well live it up
Yeah forgiveness is yours in the hands of the Lord
Ain't nothing they can do
Hell live it up

This city's looking like a ghost town
All the stores downtown they've been closing down
Yeah, the only lights that shine for miles
Are lighting up the sky above memorial drive

And if you want a seat you better come on down
'Cause when the band fires up that old glory sound
This is the moment we've all been waiting for
Lining them up, and the whistle blows

This ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing right here
A football tradition
So everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night

And winning state would be a miracle
Man, we did it back in '54
And if the baptist church prayed Sunday morning
We might just stand a chance with the help of the Lord

This is ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing right here
A football tradition
So, everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night

And now the stadium's quiet
Standing here alone on this old 50 yard line
If I listen close I can hear battle cries
Of all the heroes come and gone before I was alive
The memories of fourth and three
Now that rival game is coming back to me
It meant more than a big state ring
If we could do it again it'd never be the same
Remember the lights and the butterflies
Giving it all just one last time
Because heroes are remembered but dragons never die

This is ain't no game around here
It's more like religion
We've built this thing right here
A football tradition
So, everybody get up
And feast your eyes
On the highlight of small town life
It's Friday night

Come on

Grew up one state north of Kentucky
Family far from rollin' in the money.
Seven brothers and sisters to feed and love.

Granddaddy said she kept her eyes on the sky,
Watchin' all the little birds fly
Starin' at heaven like a lost home

None of her dreams held fame and fortune
She wanted a husband and children that loved her

Spreading her wings,
Her feet left ground in Indiana,
Traveling down south just to marry my daddy,
Leaving the life she known and loved behind.
She never cussed or drink,
Kept food on the table,
Hell I kept her on her knees in prayer.
She's a God-sent blessing willin' and able,
It's Indiana's Angel.

Baby back home your daddy's dying,
Bout then came a perfect timing,
Walked in with liquor on my breath,
I sit and watched all her tears glisten,
Said son you'll learn to listen,
A man stands tall in front of his knees.

Now I'll never forget how much that hurt,
That she said son, one day I'll be gone, you won't have to hear these words.

Spreading her wings
Her feet left ground in Indiana,
Traveling down south just to marry my daddy,
Leaving the life she known and loved behind.
She never cussed or drink,
Kept food on the table,
Hell I kept her on her knees in prayer.
She's a God-sent blessing willin' and able,
It's Indiana's Angel,
Indiana's Angel.

Spreading her wings
Her feet left ground in Indiana,
Driving down south just to marry my daddy,
Leaving the life she known and loved behind.
She never cussed or drink,
Kept food on the table,
Hell I kept her on her knees in prayer.
She's a God-sent blessing willin' and able,
It's Indiana's Angel.

I'm tired of this 9 to 5
8 hours feeling like over time
And my mind's reminding me,
I got a show tonight

Getting home, it's already 8:30
My strings are old and man, my clothes are dity
But jimmy's always late, so man I'm right on time
There's a little old college bar right off of old 129
Said they'd pay me just a little bit of money
To sing my songs tonight

It's 10:00, get ready to rock, let's roll
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
Play it all from skynyrd to Jones
And some of my own
5'10 with a suntan and southern drawl
In the front row singing along
Yeah it's all about the country sound
Yeah, we're gonna rock this town

Sweet home to brown eyed girl
Trying my best to remember the words
And there's always some drunk in the back
Screaming out Free Bird
Take a break, and head to the bar
Shake a couple hands, got me feeling like a star
And I know it's the bottle talking, hell I don't mind

Y'all I ain't cose to famous
But I love to play and sing
And this may be a honkey tonk bar
But I'm still living a dream

It's 10:00, get ready to rock, let's roll
Give me the beat boys, and free my soul
Play it all from skynyrd to Jones
And some of my own
5'10 with a suntan and southern drawl
In the front row singing along
Yeah it's all about the country sound
Yeah, we're gonna rock this town

You ain't nothin' like your memory at least it hangs around and that old photograph you gave me
Girl I can't bare to lay it down
And when this bottles empty
Girl I'm gonna paint this town
Yeah after all we're said and done
I don't have one good reason you should turn and come back home
Or the right to blame you girl I don't have much at all

And the day was to much without you yeah my life revolved around you and you dropped a stone down on my heart and now I can't move on 'cause we danced to all our songs up to midnight all alone
I still got you picture taped to the dashboard on the mantle right by the front door you said if you leave you'd never come back well baby I don't believe that's were it's at it's all of wrong times all of the right things in my right mind to say thinks I don't mean but baby that's me and it's way to late oh I still got your picture on the dashboard

She's stopping by real late tonight, just to talk.
She said I got some things that been weighing on my mind,
And I know I can come.
And we just sit and we talk a while
While she spills her heart on that couch of mine.
And it won't be long till the guitar starts to play.
I already know what she's gonna say,
Oh she says...

Play me that song, play me that song you wrote
About the girl who might not ever know,
How much you care, or how much you love her.
Play me that song, play me that song again
'Cause I like to think there's someone there
Who might love me just like that,
So play me that song again.

Wasted time on a small town guy, nothing but drama.
And she wonders why it's almost every time she cries,
She ends up at my house.
She knows I don't give a damn about the who and where, or what they said.
I just take my pride and walk away.

Play me that song, play me that song you wrote
About the girl who might not ever know,
How much you care, or how much you love her.
Play me that song, play me that song again
'Cause I like to think there's someone there
Who might love me just like that,
So play me that song again.

Girl you know I gotta tell you the truth,
I can't hide it no more.
I can't believe you didn't see through
The hiding, disguises, every time I'm singing,
Well there it is.

Baby that song, baby that song I wrote
About the girl who might not ever know,
How much I care, or how much I love her.
Baby that song, I gotta tell you the truth
I've been hiding this so long from you.
Baby that song you love so much,
Is all about you.

So man, you think you wanna run whiskey
Roll with me, helps you better listen good and clear
And if you got a badge or a big mouth
Brother, you ain't got no business here

The bonus here as the moonshine's still
You can smell that whiskey burn
This is how the big dogs run, boy, you're riding shotgun
Buckle up and let's have some fun

Riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw

A duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in your hood, heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar and brother, I'm hell on wheels
I said, I'm hell on wheels

Just nine more miles until state line
We're on time and we lost Barney's blues
So you can open your eyes, you're done fine
In this dangerous part of what we do

When we make that drop, we're gonna pop a top
You got a lesson left to learn
It ain't wine, don't sip it, make it bubble when you hit it
Let it burn, baby, burn

And we'll be riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw

There's duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in the hood heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar and brother, I'm hell on wheels, yeah
I said, I'm hell on wheels

And riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law
I got the booze in the boot, move it over Bo Duke
Make room for a real outlaw

There's duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash
There's thunder in the hood heaven from the still
Lightning in a jar

Riding 95 down the highway, sideways
Running from old John Law

Make room for a real outlaw

Duct tape on that license plate, a 6 gun in the dash

Thank you, pretty boy
I said I'm hell on wheels, yeah

Growing up I was always mama's angel
Never thought I'd ever fall from grace
I was taught to walk for God and run from trouble
But I ran with a crowd that was bound to change my ways

Yeah, I was proud to be in the bad news crowd
The one my mama warned me about
The closest thing to hell she's ever raised

But when I look back on those days
I knew I'd never change a thing
I made mistakes that paved the way
For the man I am today

I'm proud of 'em all and I had a ball
Bending the rules and breaking the law

We were bad about sneaking out and shooting road signs
Throwing eggs and rolling every yard in town
Yeah, my claim to fame was a babe, Ruth swing on a mailbox
Yeah, the police just loved driving me around

'Cause I was proud to be in the bad news crowd
The one my mama warned me about
The closest thing to hell she ever raised

But when I look back on those days
I knew I'd never change a thing
I made mistakes that paved the way
For the man I am today

I'm proud of 'em all and I had a ball
Bending the rules and breaking the law

And you learn to walk the way you talk
The D-U-I means S-O-L, respect was earned
You live and learn to pray, yeah, yeah
You learn to pray

Yeah, we were proud to be in the bad news crowd
The one our mamas warned us about
The closest thing to hell they'd ever raised

But when I look back on those days
I knew we'd never change a thing
Made mistakes that paved the way
For the men we are today

I'm proud of 'em all, yeah, and we had a ball
Bending the rules and breaking the law

Yeah, I was bending the rules and breaking the law

Mamma, she's still got that picture
Of me and Katie on home coming night
She looked pretty in that fancy dress
But that girl was a barefoot, blue jean princess

A hand full of rocks and daddy's pine ladder
Sure did come in handy
For a teenage boy thinking all that mattered
Was a kiss that taste like candy

Back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window

Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
Back in the day

Friday nights I'd look up there in the bleachers
And I can see her with my letterman's jacket on
And I still got this scar here on my right hand
From when Bobby told her she deserved a better man

Aw, she hung right with me down in Panama City
Raising hell on our senior trip
And man ain't it funny it gets the best of me
And I just can't forget, I just can't forget

Back in the day we were wild and free
She was the dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window

Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away
Back in the day

Summer was over
My college was calling man I had to watch her leave
But I still wonder if she ever thinks of me

'Cause back in the day we were wild and free
She was my dashboard drummer
Butterflies in the backseat
Little footprints on my window

Parking my Chevy by the riverside
Four letters in a heart carved in a pine
A little sun dress laying up there on the bank
While the water washed our innocence away

It feels like yesterday, back in the day
Back in the day

She says, "Look, baby, I'm a rock star"
Grabs my old guitar
Playing it upside down
Dancing 'round in front of our TV

I can't see the ballgame
So I just wave my lighter around and say
"Yeah, rock on, baby
I'd rather watch you anyway"

"But when you're done can I come backstage
And get you to sign your name
On that Zeppelin shirt of mine you're wearing?
I'll never wash that thing again"

Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve

The way she throws her little fits
Poking out her lip, biting mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kind of crazy

You ought to see her in my pickup
Oh, she's gotta have that radio up
Bless her heart, she can't sit still
Head in my lap, bare feet on the windshield

Says, "Come on, baby, let me drive"
Now honey, it's a stick shift
Remember what you did last time, oh

Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve

The way she throws her little fits
Poking out her lip, biting mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kind of crazy

She never lets me rest, she keeps me up all night
Known to roll me off the bed, steal the covers off my side
But I hear her wake up, sleepy head
And I open up my eyes and it's all worth the while

Yeah, and she's my kind of crazy
The little games she plays
Lord, they never get old
She's too cute to get on my last nerve

The way she throws her little fits
Poking out her lip, biting mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kind of crazy

Welcome to the home of a hillbilly, yeah baby
It's a land of barbed wire, moonshine, whiskey
Park your car 'fore you get it stuck
Go on grab you a beer and get on up in the truck

It's going down tonight, it's all on me
It's B-Y-O-B and I've got all we need
Yeah boy, I'm 'bout to show me a city slicker
How to kick it in the sticks with the critters down on

Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys having a dang good time

We crank it up down here, we get loud down here
Throwing down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks

So pop a top and drop a tailgate
Yeah, we cranking up AC/DC, Hank, Skynyrd and George Strait
Where's the girls? 'Bout to call 'em up
A little southern drawl said, "Hey trouble, what's up?"

It's going down tonight, now they're pulling up
We got the jacked up trucks so slap covered in mud
Bikini tops and daisy duke denim
Hopping out, singing outlaw women down on

Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys having a dang good time

We crank it up down here, we get loud down here
We're throwing down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers, they all came to kick it in the sticks

Hey boy, hit this mason job one time
Burned you a little bit, didn't it?
Ever been snipe hunting? Come on

We'll do a little frog gigging, cow tipping
Now how 'bout a little skinny dipping, bass fishing?
Take it easy on the shine, stay away from other boy's women
That's one damn good way for a man to get it whooped down

These boys tough down here
Get your ass tore up down here
And be an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks
The jocks and bikers they all came

Our side of the barbed wire
Money grows in rows, if it don't you've gone broke
So we, we hang out by the bonfire
Just some good ole' boys having a dang good time

We crank it up down here, we get loud down here
We're throwing down in the dirty, dirty south down here
Playing an all nighter with the hippies and the hicks

There's a live oak tree
You can still see off old 129
You can see the scars, its missing bark
Where it stopped my truck that night

They say I took a swing at my best friend
For trying to take my keys
Next thing I knew I was upside down
Thinking this is it for me

When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you

You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which one's your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
You live your life a better man
When you've been a halfway to Heaven

First thing I did was hug my momma
I even hugged my dad
I told them both how much I love them
Never saw daddy cry like that

Started hanging out with my little brother
Man, I never missed a game
I'm in church every Sunday morning
And I pray every day

When you see life flash before your eyes
The good, the bad, the wrong, the right
Fade into a bright white light
Shining down on you

You're hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones your last breath
Knowing there's so much you've left to do
You live your life a better man
When you've been halfway to Heaven

And I won't waste one minute
Yeah, my life's changed
And I'm gonna live it

Like I'm hanging on by a thread
Wondering which ones my last breath
Knowing there's so much I've left to do
I live my life a better man, live my life a better man
'Cause I've been halfway to Heaven

Halfway to Heaven

Amy's got the letters I wrote
My picture in a frame
She's had a year to let go
She's still wearing my ring

It hasn't left her finger
Since the night that I proposed
When I promised her forever
Before I took her home

But I never made it home that night
A part of her died too
I watched her losing her mind
And there's nothing I can do, oh

Sometimes she goes crazy
Screaming out my name
Saying, "Baby, please come and save me"
I wish she knew I'd do anything

To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything's okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
And make up for lost time

Oh, but God, I know I can't
You can't let her live this way
It's too late for saving me
But there's still hope for saving Amy

Now 3 years have gone by
She's trying to live her life
And I still watch her sometimes
Just to make sure she's alright

She knows I'll always be there
In her heart and in her dreams
'Cause God, I promised her forever
And that's one promise I intend to keep

To kiss the tears right off her face
Tell her everything's okay
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
And make up for lost time

Oh, but God, I know I can't
But you can't let her live this way
It's too late for saving me
But there's still hope for saving Amy

I'll kiss the tears right off her face
When I walk her through these gates
Feel her heartbeat next to mine
Make up for lost time

God, I thank you everyday
For giving a her that ounce of faith
That led her right back here to me
And most of all for saving Amy
Saving Amy

Thank you, God, for saving Amy
For saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy
For saving Amy, yeah

For saving Amy, for saving Amy
Saving Amy
Thank you, God, for saving Amy

Grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working, spitting, hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God

I was gassing up the other day
An old boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought, oh, good Lord, he's lost

From his Wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
A country must be country wide

In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

It ain't where, it's how you live
We weren't raised to take, we were raised to give
The shirt off our back to anyone in need

We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day, before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust and we believe

And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right

And old Hank, he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide, yeah

In every state there's a station
Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind

Playing Cash, Hank Willie and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

Back in the good old days
Knew how to brawl
I'm talking real gunslingers
I'm talking real outlaws

They'd saddle up and ride on into town
When it was high noon in them old saloons
You knew what was going down

They took it outside, took it outside
It was man to man, it's toe to toe
You know they had to go

Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until you've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside

Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside

These days things have changed
There's a lot of talk, lot of pushing and shoving
Well, if you wanna walk the walk

Well, let's have some respect
They got girls in here, just pay your tab
Lay down your beer hoss
And let's take it outside, let's take it outside

It's man to man, it's toe to toe
You know we need to go

Well, nobody's gonna break it up
Not until we've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside

Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside, yeah

We're all here for a good time
Don't start no trouble
'Cause it won't be the first time
I put a scar on my knuckles

Now brother, I don't mind
And I'll be glad to stomp your ass
But if both of us walk out that door
One of us ain't coming back

Nobody's gonna break it up
Not until we've had enough
And if you think you've got the guts
Then let's take it outside

Well, if you think your man enough
You really wanna knuckle up
If you wanna shed a little blood
Then let's take it outside, let's take it outside, yeah

Look at them boys in the back of that truck
Somebody ought to jerk a knot in their butts
Out riding around like they own this town
That racket turned all the way up

It's too early for school to let out
The Pastor's boy just threw a cigarette out
I sure hope there ain't beer in them cups
'Cause our star quarterback's turning them up

Them boys don't know one thing about life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules and balls and chains

Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?

I heard old Frank's grandson got caught
With a case full of beer that Smith boy bought
Y'all didn't hear all of this from me
But I heard they got it with a fake ID

Them boys don't know one thing about life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules or balls and chains

Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?
With them boys

Looking back on the times we've shared
From rock 'n roll to these rocking chairs
The same ones our granddads sat in

By this old wood stove in this hardware store
Talking the gossip, the weather and war
And how much trouble we were in
Oh, you can bet they said back then

Yeah, them boys don't know one thing 'bout life
True love and trouble, struggle and strife
They think it's all just fun and games
Like laws and rules or balls and chains

Treating little girls like hearts don't break
Treating old men like hands don't shake
I pray it's just a phase they're going through
Yeah, but what are we gonna do with them boys?

They don't know a thing
About love, about life
Them boys

A whisper away from changing everything
But is it safe to say such dangerous things?
And your hands are trembling
Girl, I'm weak in the knees

It's times like these
When silence means everything
More than anything

So fall when you're ready, babe
Let our kiss count the moments
And hearts set the pace
And I'll be your love song
And I'll love you right off your feet
Until you fall into me

Love ain't a race, there's no finish line
And I love a chance but don't leave me behind
'Cause, girl, we're both gambling
But I'm playing for keeps

It's times like these
When patience means everything
More than anything

So fall when you're ready, babe
Let our kiss count the moments
And hearts set the pace
And I'll be your love song
I'll love you right off your feet

And I'll fall for you every day
I'll cherish the moments, time can't erase
We'll be the love song
I promise you we're gonna sing

Girl, when you fall in me
Girl, when you fall in me
Come on, baby, fall into me, yeah
I'm waiting, fall into me, fall into me, fall into me

A whisper away from changing everything

You know I'm chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin' to some George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,

An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires

Back in the day pop bomb was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls

The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and gin were a few good friends
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man this shit is getting old

Man mind your business watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud ass out
No time for talking y'all ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missin'

You know I'm chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin' to some George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ole days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
We like cornbread and biscuits
If it's broke round here we fix it

See I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood and back in them woods
We do it different round here that's right
And we sho do it good and we do it all night

So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road wit a truck and four wheel
Jump on in tell yo friends
And we'll be raising hell where the black top ends

You know I'm chilling on the back roads,
Laid back rollin' to some George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires

Yeah I'm chillin' on the back roads
Laid back bobbin' to some George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console

Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on the good times
Sittin' turning off the real life, driving that truck
Hittin' easy street in mud tires

Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
I bet she's still crying on the front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal

'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view

Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south

'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I suppose to do
There's still more than miles in my rear view

Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her (damn)

So I'm turning back to Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can't put my dreams before her
Man I need her here with me
Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in back tonight
Now I know what I'm suppose to do, yeah
There's still more than miles in my rear view

More than miles, yeah

More than miles

Hey ol' friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Now she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
Might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say I'll stop hurting
To hear somebody say she ain't worth it,
 
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend

And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
 
I can't forget, or drink away these memories.
It fills my soul with all the little things.
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
Don't try to tell me it stops hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it
 
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend

And there's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do
 
You don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know what we've been through
That girl's my best friend

There's no way you're gonna help me
She's the only one who can
No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

They said I was baptized in dirty water
By the hands of the devil himself
Between the banks of a Whiskey River
Beside the Highway to Hell
I got scars on my heart and knuckles
I got debts that I can't pay
Yeah but I got a blessing sent down from heaven
Baby you're my saving grace

Girl you got an outlaw 
Ready to lay down all my guns
A dirty old hound dog
Learning new tricks like cuddlin' up
You've got a hellcat purrin' like a kitten
You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
Lovin' the devil outta me

You'd tell me how did I get under
This leather skin I wear
Beneath the callouses and tattoos
Around the walls I've built down there
To this heart I've broke and guarded
All alone out on the street flyin' 
Yea it takes an angel to fly with a freebird
Baby we've got the sky

Girl you got an outlaw 
Ready to lay down all my guns
A dirty old hound dog
Learning new tricks like cuddlin' up
You've got a hellcat purrin' like a kitten
You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
Lovin' the devil outta me

Hell on an angel, on an angel

Girl you got an outlaw 
Ready to lay down all my guns
A dirty old hound dog
Learning new tricks like cuddlin' up
You've got a hellcat purrin' like a kitten
You've got a sinner down on his knees
It had to be hell on an angel
Lovin' the devil outta me

I'm sure you've heard my reputation it's all over this small town
But there's a little bit of fire under all that smoke
You know how word gets around
Back in the day you were a straight A student
Daddy's little girl, honey what are you doin'
Talkin' 'bout lettin' your hair down
We'll take a ride on the wild side of town

If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sittin' in the parkin' lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't gonna wanna come back
'Cause I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you wanna ride with me?
Gonna raise some hell, gonna make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy

Well I'll be out by your driveway when your mom and dad lay down
You can climb on out that window babe
And we'll get on out of town
I'll call up all my rowdy friends
We'll throw down where the dirt road ends
I'll have you back before the rooster crows
Girl your mom and daddy ain't gotta know

If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sittin' in the parkin' lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't gonna wanna come back
'Cause I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you wanna ride with me?
Gonna raise some hell, gonna make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Want a bad boy

Slide over here

If you want a bad boy then baby you got it
Got a bad toy sittin' in the parkin' lot
Take you to the wrong side of the tracks
Baby you ain't gonna wanna come back
'Cause I'm a free bird and damn proud of it
You're a sweet girl, are you sure you wanna ride with me?
Gonna raise some hell, gonna make some noise
If you want a bad boy
Bad boy

Girl you know you want a bad boy

There ain't nothing like 'em first loves baby
Remember them high school days
Friday nights come n' dances
Givin' my old letterman's jacket away
To hold us a name

But now it's you and me talking on the phone 'til 4 AM
About anything and everything
Making me feel young again like ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again

I thought them feelings was long gone baby
But you take me back in time
Just like spring break in Panama City
Girl from Indiana sure was pretty
But she ain't got nothin' on you tonight

'Cause you're like the summer lovin' don't come or go
Never had to say goodbye
I wake up in the morning feeling like a first kiss
Every time your lips touch mine

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
To climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get the butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again

Lookin' back I wish I could put you inside every memory
(Every memory)
You can be my first love
My first kiss
My first and last everything

Makes me wanna sneak down your driveway
And climb out your window
Get in girl, we'll roll 'til the dirt road ends
You can climb up in that back seat
With your pretty little bare feet
Get your butterflies like we used to
Got our innocence
Just like we're 17 again
Yeah just like we're 17 again

17 again
Oh

You might be sitting there holding my hand
And you might be acting like you're my man
While we listen to the cover band, thinking you're a rockstar,
Singing my favorite song
Trying to cover up the fact that the girl from your past
Hasn't been here all along

You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go
I think we both know
I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing
Baby, I'm the one you're losing, you can't help it
You keep choosing your ex, oh

I might be platinum blond, but I ain't dumb
Baby, I see you're here with me, but you ain't moved on
Sitting in the middle of a flame still burning,
Boy, I ain't your match
You can stop all the pretending 'cause when this night's ending
You're still gonna want her back

You're still in love with your ex, oh
And I ain't one to be nobody's second best, no
Stop holding onto me when the truth is you can't let go

I'm looking in your eyes and I can see just what you're doing

The smile, the charm, the words, the spark,
Everything, you had it
I guess I had a naive heart, cause boy,
I let you have it
You said I was your only,
I never thought you'd leave me lonely
You're just a lost boy, 

You're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,
Peter Pan

Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true
But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you
But now it's happily ever never
I guess now I know better
You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds
You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground

You're always gonna fly away, just because you know you can
You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man,

You're just a lost boy, yeah, I know who you are
You don't know what you lost, boy,
You're too busy chasing stars

You're never gonna learn there's no such place as Neverland
You don't understand
You'll never grow up
You're never gonna be a man

Yeah, you'll never grow up

And leaving the girls crying out in the rain
So tell me, baby

If you're gonna kiss me kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not you best get to leaving

If you wanna keep me keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it and make me believe it
If you're gonna love me boy love me like you mean it

Looking for a heart to break
So if you're like that
Well take a step back

'Cause I don't have time to waste on the boys

What if we were all the same?
Same rules, same game
And we weren't allowed to change anything about anything 
That anybody's ever done before?
Wouldn't that be boring?, yeah

Always spinning on a ride, all walking on a line
That they drew a long time ago
When you know that you don't have to go where they go
You can go write your own story

Hey, hey, you gotta be
Who you oughta be
So who do you wanna be?
Oh

You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say you can be, a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round

La da da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da

There's a lot of open doors you can go and explore
You can always open more if you're hitting a wall
Dropping the ball, haven't we all
Been down that same hallway?
So let 'em talk and whisper, let 'em try to fix ya
Repaint your picture, at the end of the day
It fits in your frame, just 'cause you're different don't mean you're crazy

Hey, hey, you gotta sing
Like nobody's listening 
'Cause somebody's listening, yeah
Oh

You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind
You can be what they say you can be, a cliche
You can tear up the box and throw it away
Everybody gotta be themselves
Everybody gotta dream out loud
Everybody gotta be themselves
Square pegs make the world go 'round

They make the world go 'round

Hey, hey, you gotta be

So who do you wanna be?
Whoa, oh

You can choose if you're bad, if you're good
If you're left or right, speaking your heart or speaking your mind

I put on my make up
Spray my perfume
Sat on the front porch, waitin' on you
Said we would catch up because it had been awhile
I hate to admit it
But my hands are shaking
Barely breathin'
Heart is racin'
Looks like feelings don't always change their minds

But you never called, never showed up
Guess somethings never change
And just like living in a flashback... you let me down again

That's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at the driveway
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothings changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
The first time

I should know better
I hate that I still cry
Lookin' like a fool here watchin' for headlights
And kickin' myself for believin' in you again
I bet your out drinkin' with a new blonde and
Telling her whatevers playin' is her song
Yeah and helping her up into your Chevy instead

Even when you don't have me
You can still be the one to hurt me
It must feel good to know
That I'm still holdin' on to letting go

That's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at the driveway
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothings changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
The first time

Yeah that's why the past should be the past
Far behind, back of mind, out of the way
Let the memories burn and crash
'Cause sittin' here looking at the driveway
Is just tearin my heart back in half
Like nothings changed except the time that's passed
And that's why good-bye should mean good-bye
So I'm letting you go, just like I should have tried
The first time

The night is young and so are we, so you what you say
We go and see it all for ourselves?
Yeah, yeah
There's a spot I know down the road we can go
Only me and you and no one else
Yeah, yeah

I ain't looking for a crowd
Another night on the town
I want a one way ticket where the creaking crickets
Are the only sound

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark,
Looking at stars

We can rename constellations while we're making wishes
Don't it make you feel so small?
Yeah, yeah
We can talk about forever for a minute, maybe never,
Just kiss and say nothing at all
Yeah, yeah

Baby, hurry up and get here
So we can disappear
The clouds are breaking, don't keep me waiting
Never seeing a night this clear

So baby, pick me up, I'll be in the drive
Take me where the moon's hanging in the sky
We can park it by the river, get out and throw the tailgate down down down
You can steal a kiss, maybe even two
Only the track and the tree's gonna see what we do
All I wanna be is wrapped in your arms, laying in the dark,
Looking at stars

(Ooh)

Well, your reputation beats you to this
Little town like breaking news
Of a devastation that you left behind
Well, I ain't scared of a little rain
And I watch that spinning weather vane
I guess I just ain't the running kind

(Ooh, ooh)
They all watch from windows as I ran that dark cloud down
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooh)
Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the
(Ooh)
The warning lights were flashing like lightning
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the sirens

Well, I let you crumble every wall
With your hail as hard as a cannonball
'Cause I like the risk that's in your reckless touch
And I've always had a weakness for
A terrible and twisted storm
'Cause your kiss is an adrenaline rush

(Ooh, ooh)
I knew what I was chasing when I ran that dark cloud down
You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the

Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the

Oh, mmm

Maybe I'll know better the next time I hear that
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, yeah

You were nothing but trouble, baby
And I've been sifting through the rubble lately
I should've listened to the, I should've listened to the

Wanted to dance in the eye of danger
Knowing good well I'd regret it later

Sometimes you could hear a pin drop or the ticking of the clock
Between the surface conversation, no matter what they were saying
They never talked

Sometimes I would hear 'em screaming, when they thought that I was sleeping
They'd just fight about whatever, I don't know if they ever had a reason

Am I the product of a problem that I couldn't change?
Got his eyes, got her hair
So do I get their mistakes?

I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke

Sometimes I hear myself saying hand-me-down words
It's so easy to forget that he ain't him and I ain't her

And when I think the fighting has to end in a goodbye,
I wanna prove me wrong, but I'm scared I'll prove me right, 'cause

I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
On that secondhand smoke

Oh, no

Will I be better, find forever, be the one to shake the habit,
Break away from broken things, and rise above the ashes?

I know that you can't walk across a bridge that's already burned, so
What am I supposed to do?, I can't help that they chose
To breathe it in, but I don't wanna choke
No, I ain't gonna choke
On that secondhand smoke

Oh

I know everybody wants you
That ain't no secret
Hey baby what's your status?
And tell me are you trynna keep it?
Well, they can all back off
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got your attention
Did I mention:

If you got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
If you got a heart that ain't afraid of love ain't afraid to break
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying, I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah

I'll calling dibs
On your lips
On your kiss
On your time
Boy, I'm calling dibs
On your hand
On your heart
All mine

Make everybody jealous
When I take you off the market
And get my lipstick on your right cheek
'Cause boy I've got to mark it
Ooh
So they can all back off
Yeah
'Cause I know what I want
And while I've got you listening
Come on and show me what I'm missing
Yeah

If you you've got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
If you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love ain't afraid to break
If you've got a Friday night free and a shotgun seat
Well I'm just saying I ain't got nowhere to be
So baby I'll take whatever it is you've got to give
Yeah, I'm calling dibs

If you've got a kiss on your lips that you're looking for somebody to take
Hey, if you've got a heart that ain't afraid to love ain't afraid to break

Go ahead and say what you're gonna say
Give it to me straight, don't sugarcoat it
Go ahead and do what you're gonna do
We're already done, I already know it
So you can take your new blonde out to get your drink on
For everyone to see
But you don't get to get to me

I wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
'Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl,
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I wear my pain like stilettos

So I ain't staying down, tonight I'm going out
Yeah, even if I have to fake it
A little black dress to cover my mess
So you won't know my heart is breaking
Pull myself together from the fallout of forever
For everyone to see
No, you don't get to get to me

I wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know
I keep walking with my head up, putting on a show
And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
'Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl,
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I wear my pain like stilettos

Yeah, I wear my pain like stilettos

Oh, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh

I wear my pain like stilettos
As bad as it may hurt, no, you'll never know

And fronting like nothing is wrong
I talk the talk like I'm a tough girl
'Cause there ain't room for weakness in a rough world
That keeps saying you were never enough, girl,
Yeah, when you get burned, you learn to be strong
I wear my pain like stilettos

Captured my attention, make my heart stop and listen
When you look my way
Blue jeans and a ball cap, thinking that you're all that
And I'm thinking the same

You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the same
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine

Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road

Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone

Yeah, boy
I'm digging what you're doing
Yeah, boy
I'm trying to keep it cool
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
You shine and you can't even help it
Yeah, boy
Your eyes could make the moon jealous
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy

Yeah, boy
I wanna take a little ride with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna spend a little time with you
Yeah, boy
I wanna sip a little wine with you

Young,
All we ever think about is fun
All we ever wanna be is 21
Hey, doesn't everyone wanna sit on top of the world?
Revolves around athletic boys and girls
Dressed up in their older sister's clothes, R. Kelly on the radio
Screaming out, "This'll never get old"

Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
Underage
Underage

Time,
Feels like it's always on our side
So we fill it up with midnight drives and lies
To your mama when she asks you where you've been
And you hide your smile and say anywhere but with him
'Cause you know when she was seventeen
She was doing the same damn thing

Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
Underage
Underage

Every light is saying "go"
When you don't know what you don't know

Racing cars and breaking hearts
First taste of love and twist-off wine
Kissing strangers, daring danger
Burning bridges, crossing lines
You don't think to take it slow
And you don't know what you don't know
The nights are young and our IDs are fake
The kind of days that are "those were the days"
Underage
Underage

Young,
All we ever think about is fun
Doesn't everyone?

I don't wanna be another skeleton in your closet
Another rose that you throw, 'cause you know that it ain't okay
Just a name on a stone in a row down the road forgotten
'Cause I was falling fast, now I'm just a dash between two dates

I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar

So you can find another hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me

Maybe I was naive to believe you would never hurt me
But now I know why you hide in your darkest suit and shades?
You put on a show, so nobody knows your hands and your shoes are dirty
I guess you don't need a shovel to dig a grave

I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar

So you can find another hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me, yeah

You gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down
You gonna go out one night when you see me out
'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down

I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard
In the cold, hard dirt that you throw down
I don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar

So you can find another hopeless, broken girl in a little black dress
And you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace
Right here next to me

Hopeless, broken girl
And you just take her, break her heart
Let her rest in peace
Right there next to me
I don't wanna be another heart
I don't wanna be another heart
In your graveyard, babe
In your graveyard, hey

I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you (when it ended)
I thought it hurt me (but it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

I thought I'd miss you (when it ended)
I thought it hurt me (but it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more
(I miss me more)
(I miss me more)

You saw me drive by your place last Friday
But don't make too much of it, it's just on my way home
I didn't see the picture that you posted in this bar
And when I pulled into the parking lot, I didn't see your car

You can tell your friends it's all on purpose
That I'm the crazy ex that wrecks your life
But there's no intentions underneath the surface
So don't go reading anything between the lines

'Cause I'm over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I've never felt better
I didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I'm over you thinking that every move that I'm making
Is just a game that I'm playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
So get over yourself
Yeah
So get over yourself

You think all I do is talk about us
And that the new boy I show off is only out of spite
You're so in your head about it, you can't get your heart around it
But boy, I'm over you
I'm over you

I'm over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I've never felt better
I didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I'm over you thinking that every move that I'm making
Is just a game that I'm playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
So get over yourself

Guess what else?
Took all your pictures down off of my shelf
And I don't care enough to hate you so I even wish you well, boy
So you can tell your friends I do it all on purpose, yeah
That I'm the crazy ex that wrecks your life

But I'm over you and everything that we used to do together
My Saturday nights are brighter, I've never felt better
I didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else
And I'm over you thinking that every move that I'm making
Is just a game that I'm playing because my heart is still breaking
Boy, I'm over you
I'm over you
So get over yourself
Yeah
So get over yourself
'Cause I'm over you
So get over yourself

You brought them to my door
Stood there on the front porch
That was the beginning
We had those tires spinning
Down on the green grass
Outside of town
Wild and free, never slowing down
I thought I needed you like air

We burned hot, burned out, like a flame
But in my head, you'll never fade

Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn't know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses
We were roses

You put one in my hair
Danced in the middle of nowhere
You and me all summer
Bright and living color

My lips were red
Your eyes were blue
And I thought I saw forever in you

Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn't know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses

The seasons had to change
And like flowers they bloom and withered away

Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
It was so good while it lasted

Yeah, we were classic
My dress, your leather jacket
Didn't know how good we had it
But, boy, we had it
14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries
Yeah, we didn't know it
Thought we could grow it
Beautiful for a moment
We were roses

I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too
Like it was metal
Like it was bulletproof
I forgot to cry when I was sad
I forgot to fight when I was mad
I made the moves that others would approve
But it ain't calculated
It ain't by the rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it's gonna do what it's gonna do, yeah

I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You'll see it break
You'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have a machine heart
No, a machine heart

I kept it quiet
But know you'll hear it scream
'Cause good or bad or right or wrong
It's finally found its beat
And it ain't calculated
It ain't bother rules
And you can hate it, baby
But it's gonna do what it's gonna do, yeah

I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You'll see it break
You'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, I don't have a machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)

I want always get it right
But hey it matches life
At least you're getting something real
I want always get it right
But hey ain't that just life?
I want it back, wanna feel

And 'cause I don't have a machine heart
Can't tell it to stop
No button to push to start
You'll see it break
You'll see it fall apart
'Cause I don't have, no I don't have a machine heart (a machine heart)
A machine heart (a machine heart)

I pushed and pulled it
I let you do it too

I pushed and pulled it

But I don't have a machine heart
No I don't have a machine heart

In between, just a fling, in the rain
In between, in apartment and a front porch swing
In between, cheap and fancy, a guitar and a Grammy
In between, reckless and responsibility

Sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes, I'm her friend
Sometimes, I play grown up
And sometimes, I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
I've done enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
(In between)

In between beer and a basement
In a Napa Valley vacation
In between, home, town and a neon city
In between, underestimated and overexpectated
Who I was and who I'm gonna be

Sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes, I'm her friend
Sometimes, I play grown up
And sometimes, I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
I've done enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
I know I won't

I'm half head up in the clouds
Half feet down on the ground
'Cause it ain't that simple
As a number, sitting on a page
When they say "act your age"
But you're stuck there in the middle

Sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter
Sometimes, I'm her friend
Sometimes, I play grown up
And sometimes, I play pretend
Sometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls
And sometimes I just wanna scream "I'm not a little girl"
I've done enough to think I know it all
Smart enough to know I don't
Young enough to think I'll live forever
Old enough to know I won't
In the end, in between
In the end, in between

He's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's still wearing that red and black jersey
Waiting for the band to start up
He's still showing up twenty late, finding hearts and rules to break
Why would he wanna change when every memory still bows to him?

But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school

He's still calling that first love, first time, pretty-eyed blonde
And she's still letting it ring 'cause his ring isn't what she wants
'Cause she traded in prom queen for a big city dream
And a slate that's clean, but
Your heart just don't get it and that's why you can't forget it
'Cause you're living like you're seventeen

But this ain't high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday, take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up and the world gets cruel when...

You're still living in the hallways
Where everybody stopped and stared
And cared and knew your name
'Cause this is the real world that don't know you like that
You can remember but you can't go back

To high school
Where all you care about is if the pretty cheerleader thinks you're cool
See her Friday when you take her out after the football game
'Cause it's five years later and you can't get off of the elevator
That's going up, 'cause you're growing up
And the world gets cruel when you're still living in high school

When you're still living in...
Five years later
Oh yeah, oh yeah
He's still calling that first love, first time
And he hates he said goodbye, she went on with her life
He's still driving the same old back roads
Wondering when he got so old
Where did his life go?
Oh, but he knows
Oh, he knows
Yeah, he knows
That this ain't high school, oh, woah
And he's still driving that 1970 hand-me-down truck
And he's stuck in high school
But this ain't high school

Dark as midnight and lost in it
Insecure and just done with it
Love gave up, so I stop believing
That I don't know how to get through feelings

I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes, they lost their shine
But just like a love line run on time
I met you at the end of the world

The sky kept falling, but we danced in it
I was done with love, but second chance did it
You cleared the smoke and picked up the wreckage
Got to go through hell to get to heaven

I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes, they lost their shine
But just like a love line run on time
I met you at the end of the world, the world, the world

I thought the cold would last forever
I didn't know that there was something better
Waiting at the end of the world, the world, the world

I thought it was the end of the world
But it kept spinning round, round, round
And then the sun came up again
And I stopped looking down, down, down
I thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes, they lost their shine
But just like a love line run on time
I met you at the end of the world, the world, the world

I thought it was the end of the world
I thought it was
Dark as midnight and lost in it
The sky kept falling, but we danced in it

I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting
Two names in a heart-shaped tattoo
I think cupid is stupid and violets are purple not blue
I hate catching bouquets, the honeymoon phase
And letterman jackets don't fit
Your eyes can't hold stars and you'd die if your heart really skipped

I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

I hate pink hearts with glitter and Valentine's dinner
And roses just die in a week
We were drunk when we met so we don't know our anniversary
And I'm far too vain to kiss in the rain
The clouds, they aren't numbered to nine
And you make me feel something but it sure as hell ain't butterflies

I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you
Yeah

And I'll always love you but I don't have to sing it
"For worse or for better" don't rhyme
They say I got the right one so now I should write one
But I'd rather just show you tonight

I hate love songs
Yeah, I really do
I hate love songs
But I love you

I hate love songs
The old and the new
I hate love songs
But I love you

They're gonna say I fell too fast
They're gonna say it's never gonna last
And before it's too late, I should just back away
Yeah, they're gonna say that
He ain't the kind to hold my hand
He ain't gonna try to understand
Nothing under the surface
He's just looking for a pretty face

But they got it all wrong
I got it all right
They say they just don't see it
But I saw it at first sight

And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even phase me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love

So I could care less if I'm being careless
Might wreck me to be reckless
But I'd rather fall apart than
Love half-hearted
Yeah, maybe it's true that you know when you know
And then again maybe you don't
But when you find a diamond
You can't keep it from shining

And I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even phase me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love

The life of my party
He keeps my eyes starry
So I'm so sorry for not being sorry

I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love

I'm unapologetically in love
And that's unapologetically enough
No matter where it takes me
Even if it breaks me
I'm unapologetically all in
From the second that I started falling
And it don't even phase me
When they call me crazy
I'm unapologetically in love
I'm unapologetically in love

They're gonna say I fell too fast
Yeah, they're gonna say it's never gonna last
Unapologetically

It all starts when it's me and you, going out on Friday night
Feels like the radio and your tires rolling to my drive
Then my heart stops, like a beat drop
It's a symphony when you sweet talk
Make this quiet town, feel electric, loud
When the lights going down
Every word out of your mouth

Is like music
Like a '70s soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
When I'm saying nothing
But it's feeling something like music

Before I knew your love
Even with the volume up, it was silent then
And now you're walking in the room all kind of smooth, like a violin
Everybody else is white noise
So talk to me, cause your voice

Is like music
Like a '70s soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
When I say nothing
But it's feeling something like music

I-I-I

Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again just like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Your song on my skin is like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
So play it again
My whole heart's listening to your music

Like a '70s soundtrack
When you look at me like that
I lose it
My name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss
When I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out
When I say nothing
But it's feeling something like music

We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood sweat and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends

Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood sweat and heartbeats
We didn't do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

And that's why we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends
Oh, whoa

We were legends
Loving you baby it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, we'd never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember baby?

Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And they'll remember
We were legends
We were
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, we wrote our own story

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Dierks Bentley)

If lonesome was money I'd be set for life
I'd be swimmin in riches instead of tears I've cried
The blues would be worth a whole lot of green
You'd never hear one complaint from me
If lonesome was money I'd be set for life

If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone
I'd always have someone here to love me and to hold
I'd leave misery's clutches and find love's embrace
This frown you see a smile would replace
If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone

How I'd like to change lonesome
To mean something happy and free
But I know that won't ever happen you see
Lonesome will always be me
Lonesome will always be me

If lonesome was a liquor I could run a still
Bottle up my tears and let the folks drink their fill
It'd be happy hour all the time seven days a week
And laughter's all you'd ever hear from me
If lonesome was a liquor I could run a still

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Dierks Bentley)

I know things haven't gone like you planned
And for that I'm partly to blame
You didn't want to fall in love not yet
'Cause you've still got so many dreams to chase

And love is a double edged sword
It lets you walk though life feeling content
But that's a feeling you say you can't afford
And you'd be better off bein lonely again

But please don't leave me
Leave me in love
Before you walk away break my heart
Let me give you up
If you need your freedom
To find yourself
Release me from these chains of love
Lord knows I need your help
But please don't leave me
Don't leave me in love

You ask if you can hold me one last time
Sweetheart, you know I can't resist
You say tonight we'll fall asleep as lovers
But tomorrow we'll wake up as friends

How can I ever love somebody new
If I can't get my heart back from you

So please don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me in love
Don't leave me in love
Don't leave me

They come from Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabam
Way down in Texas from all over this land
Each one has a dream and a thousand different goals
But the one that they all share is that midnight radio

They're gonna be big stars in big cars and wear nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
They'll be ridin' on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio

It started with a fiddler, then banjo and guitar
And Roy Acuff was its first singing star
Hank and Minnie and Mr. Monroe
We all sang with them through that radio

We were big stars in big cars and wearin nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
We were riding on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio

This world keeps on changing for the better they say
But the more we move ahead the more I miss the old ways
Hey I don't mind the modern and as far as I can see
I'll keep trying to make the future part of history

And be a big star in a big car and wearin nudie suits
Featured on the Opry in rhinestone boots
I'll be riding on a rainbow to a wall hung with gold
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio
Hillbilly dreams on the midnight radio

Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids

Bartenders listen when you talk
And bar stools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best friend
Until the music stops and closin' time begins

Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids

Outside lies a heart that's been broke
But in here it's a world of song and smoke
That way my eyes and ears can lie to me
While I drink another shot of make believe

Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids

Bartenders, bar stools, and barmaids

(Ryan McCord / Dierks Bentley)

I never thought I'd see the day
That she'd set me free
Cause you know that little ring on my finger
Always felt like a ball and chain to me

All those threats I made about leavin'
Suddenly became reality
She released me from my death row sentence
And said we'll sign the final papers in a week

She handed me my walking papers
And said you're free to go
And celebrating felt in order
For I had escaped that prison of a home
But sittin' in this old tavern
Surrounded by my good timing friends
I see I'll never make it on the outside
And I'm thinkin' bout how I'm gonna break back in

Daylight found me sleepin' in my car
On the other side of her street
And the grass that used to be my front yard
Had never before looked so green

And I'm tempted to break for the front door
But I'm sure she'd sic the dogs on me
Cause it looks like she's got a new inmate
Cause there's a pickup in the drive I've never seen

I'm thinkin' about how I'm gonna break back in

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There's things in my life that I've been missin'
The touch of a woman, and lovin' after dark
Come here lately, with the woman I've been kissin'
She comes from Kentucky, boys, and she don't have a heart

Bartender, he don't mind, he sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name

I used to be so afraid of dyin'
I lived every moment for lovin' her
But when she walked away my heart quit tryin'
And now, I'm no stranger to hurt

Bartender, he don't mind, he sets 'em up the same
I ain't been sober since it's over, got no plans to change
I traded my tomorrows to remain in yesterday
Whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name

Bartender, he don't mind he sets 'em up the same
Oh, whiskey tears are fallin' here and each one cries her name

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Dierks Bentley)

I wake up every morning lonesome out of my mind
Reach across my bed what do I find
Sometimes a pillow sometimes a warm body
But they both leave me cold and feeling so empty

I need to find the right one right away
I can't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I go out I'm just diggin deeper in my grave
I wonder if I'm ever gonna find
The one that'll bring me piece of mind
The one on who I can set my heart free
This livin' single is gonna be the death of me

When the sun is high that's when I reach my low
And I vow to change my life and the places I go
But the sun starts sinkin and so do my big plans
And it ain't too long before a cold one's in my hand

Now if I die before I find her
Play her this song as a reminder
Of what might have been if we had met
Before I met this timely death

I couldn't find the right one right away
I couldn't keep goin' on livin' this way
Each night I went out I was just diggin deeper in my grave
I wondered if I was ever gonna find
The one that'd bring me piece of mind
The one on who I could set my heart free
This livin' single it's been the death of me
This livin' single it's been the death of me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Mike Ward / Dierks Bentley)

Like the leaves I get restless
I just can't seem to settle down
When the autumn wind blows, it cuts right to my soul
And pulls my roots out of the ground

Lonesome why do you love me you won't leave me
Why can't we ever be apart
Just when love finds me your chains they bind me
Forever shackled to your heart
Lonesome why do you love me

Rain ain't fallin' on my windshield
But there's tears in my rearview
Nature's dyin' I know behind she's cryin
Why do we leave them sad and blue

You won't leave me

Why do you love me
You won't let me be won't set me free
Lonesome why do you love me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Jason Carter / Scott Boyd / Dierks Bentley)

It's dark outside my window and cold without you near
I keep thinkin' back on the times when you were mine
But rings and dreams don't matter 'cause I know you're with him tonight
And you've already left without a fight

What can I do to make you believe my love is true
What can I say to keep you from walkin' away
How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you

The dawn will bring a new day and I suppose the sun will shine
But it won't bring back the light in my life
'Cause I'm afraid I've waited too long to tell you how I feel
It's sad to think I lost you 'cause I couldn't lose my pride

How can I make my heart believe we're really through
When it's not through loving you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Mark Ward)

Called you up about an hour ago
No one answered guess you weren't home
Since you left I've had a lot of time to think

Been a month of Mondays since I took a drink
Poured what I had stashed down the kitchen sink
Bein angry it ain't no way to live
Takin' more than I'll ever give
I only wish this pain would go away

Cause home is where the hurt is
Still tryin' to find myself
Stuck here in the middle of lonesome
Wishin I was somewhere else
And this achin heart wasn't filled with bitterness
So alone
Cause home is where the hurt is

Silence he ain't a stranger now
I've come to know him well somehow
Too often dreams echo with the shadows

All I know is I need a friend
Waitin on the bitter end
Bein angry ain't no way to be
Can you believe what's become of me
And all I want is to feel your skin again

Home, Home
Home is where the hurt is
I'm so alone
Home is where the hurt is
The heart is gone
Home is where the hurt is

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?

Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

When a mountain of a man with a "born to kill" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'?

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'

Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

That old picture frame keeps hangin' 'round
Cause' I ain't ready yet to take it down
But every now and then I'll slam the door
Shake it loose and she'll hit the floor
But I can't throw a good thing away
I wish it would break

I swear my trucks got a haunted radio
Cause' I hear you in every song
But I know what the silence makes me do
So I keep givin' those buttons more abuse
I wonder how much punchin' it can take
I wish it would break

Then I could move on right on
Down the line
Where I don't see you need you
In my life
But you're wrapped around me
Your memory's bound me like a chain
I wish it would break

And this old heart of mine's got a mind of its own
And it's decided not to let you go
Even though your love's no longer here
It won't let me shed one tear
Cause' it's still holdin' onto yesterday
I wish it would break

I wish it would break
I wish it would break
Go on and break

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm gonna build a fire in the middle of July
Burn your pictures and go for a drive
Down to the river watch the ink from your love letters fade
Come back home and turn that old mattress over
Pour out the whiskey, try wakin' up sober
Gonna change it all tonight, gonna do whatever it takes

Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a-thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
And there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
My mind might be the last thing ya make me lose
But I'll forget about you

I heard that old Jones song just the other day
'Bout a man who took a broken heart to his grave
But I'll be damned if a memory's gonna lay me down
I might be walkin' around with a head full of air
Actin' kinda crazy but I don't care
A heart barely beatin' but I'll still be above the ground

Yeah, 'cause I've lost weight and I've lost hair
And I don't intend to ever go back there
Drinkin' and a-thinkin' 'bout a love that just wasn't true
And there's a good chance I'll end up insane
Without enough sense to come in from the rain
My mind might be the last thing ya make me lose
But I'll forget about you

'Cause I've lost sleep and I've lost years
And there ain't no tellin' how many tears
My mind's gonna be the last thing ya make me lose
But I'll forget about, I'll forget about you
I'll forget about you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Pullin' into the fast lane on the leavin' side of town
Just me and the dreams I've left undone
There's a lot of roads I can point this Chevy down
But I can only think of one

On this river of concrete slab a man could drive for days
And let his imagination run
There's time for a million memories along the way
But I can only think of one, oh, I can only think of one

Summer down in Galveston, underneath the stars
A fire burnin' on the sand, ragin' in our hearts
If there's a time in my whole life I've really been in love
I can only, I can only, I can only think of one

I'm not gonna back 'til I'm back to where you are
To undo the damage that's been done
There may be a hundred ways to mend this broken heart
But I can only think of one, oh, I can only think of one 

Summer down in Galveston, underneath the stars
A fire burnin' on the sand, and you back in my arms
If there's a time in my whole life I've really been in love
I can only, I can only, I can only think of one

I learned how to write it when I first started school,
Some bully didn't like it, he said it didn't sound to cool,
So I had to hit him and all I said when the blood came,
It's my last name

Grandpa took it off to Europe to fight the Germans in the war,
It came back on some dogtags nobody wears no more,
It's written on a headstone in the field where he was slain,
It's my last name

Passed down from generations too far back to trace,
I can see all my relations when I look into my face,
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame,
It's my last name

Daddy always told me far back as I recall,
Son, your part of somethin', you represent us all,
So keep it how you got it, as solid as it came,
It's my last name

Passed down from generations too far back to trace,
I can see all my relations when I look into my face,
May never make it famous but I'll never bring it shame,
It's my last name

So darlin' if you're wonderin' why I've got you here tonight,
I wanna be your husband, I want you to be my wife,
I ain't got much to give you but what I got means everything,
It's my last name, oh, It's my last name

I learned how to write it when I first started school

Midnight stoplight, happens every time
Pretty girl in a car
No resemblance whatsoever
I wonder how you are
Constant question poundin' in my brain
Is anybody loving you these days

Lonesome pillow, sun comes yellow
I reach across the bed
Should be hurried, workin', worries
I lie there instead
With the thought that's drivin' me insane
Is anybody loving you these days

Damn this small town, every place that I go
I drive by your house, I see his car and I know
He's there with you, but when he kisses you
Think about the memories we made, and tell me
Is anybody loving you these days

Second chances, backward glances
Most people just say no
World keeps turnin', heart keeps yearnin'
I keep holdin' the hope
One day you might answer with my name
Is anybody loving you these days

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the boulevard
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you, yeah my love will follow you

My love will follow you
Down every highway of your soul
You can leave me far behind
But my love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go

So close the door, turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
Even on a road that takes you down where
Cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you, yeah my love will follow you

If you should go so far, that you cannot get back
Girl, you may not remember, but my heart will not lose track

So go ahead and take that train
In my heart you'll still remain
My love will follow you, my love will follow you
My love will follow you
Oh, follow you
My love will follow you

It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doin'
How I'm holdin' up
Since you did me wrong

Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me

Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Cause' it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Gettin' ride every night
With every single ever-lovin' girl in sight, so

Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me

Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause'
She was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever-lovin' eyes off me so

Well how am I doin' since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doin' since you did what you done to me

Well I don't know what you were thinkin'
Runnin' round on me
Now you say you're sorry
Well honey I agree... so

How are you doin' since you did
What you done to me
Girl don't lie you know you cry
Cause' you know how good it used to be
Yeah, tell me does the thought of
Losin' my true love make it hard to sleep, baby
How are you doin' since you did
What you done to me

Yeah how are you doin', now that you know
How I'm doin' since you did
What you done to me

Every day I swim an ocean fightin' your memory like endless waves
I've surrendered to the truth, I'll always love you but I know someday
I'm gonna reach the banks of a distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore

Once in a while I'll ride the river of whiskey wishes from an old shot glass
But the way it used to be, follows me downstream, so I keep knockin' 'em back
Till I reach the distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore

Someday I'm gonna get there
It might take my last prayer

But one these days I'm gonna cross that ocean, some sweet angel will set me free
And they'll tell my story, sing a song about glory, and read Psalms 23
When I reach the banks of that distant shore
Where I won't miss you anymore

Gonna rest my soul in the hands of the Lord
Where I won't miss you anymore

Designer names and diamond rings
Are just some of the finer things
I thought it took to keep her satisfied
But a bank account and credit cards
A circle drive through an acre yard
Couldn't fill that lonesome feelin'
That she held inside

I bought her fancy clothes for all occasions
And that new car so she could go
Just any old where she pleased
I bought that golden band she wore
On the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me

Leavin' early and stayin' out late
I thought for sure her love would wait
Until the day that I could find the time
But all the things that she expected
Were all the things that I neglected
For what she wanted most from me
Would not have cost a dime

I bought her fancy clothes for all occasions
And that new car so she could go
Just any old where she pleased
I bought that golden band she wore
On the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me

I bought the golden band she wore
On the hand that closed the door
And I bought the shoes that just walked out on me
Yes, I bought those shoes that just walked out on me

Every time I hear the whistle whine
From a lonesome locomotive comin' down the line
It carries my mind away to another place in time
When train travelin' across the land was the only way to fly

Am I a fool to think it glamorous
Box-carrin' like a hobo, it must have been rough
But a simpler way of life is what it really means to me
When we weren't so dependent on money to be free

I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
There you go again train travelin'

I'm lyin' on a rotten wooden floor
Smell yesterday's whiskey here rattlin' at the door
Railroad man lookin' for me I'm scared as I can be
I open my eyes and realize it's just another dream

I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
But there you go again train travelin'
Yeah, There you go again train travelin'

I hear you train, are you travelin' my way
Won't you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
Who knows what I could see from that old time machine
Oh, but there you go again train travelin'
Yeah, There you go again train travelin' 
There you go again train travelin'

These old boots still got a lot of ground
They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonnna settle down
I've got news for you
I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two
But I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So lovin' me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose
'Cause I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

Yeah, I still got a leavin' left to do

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Come a little closer, baby
I feel like layin' you down
On a bed sweet surrender
Where we can work it all out
There ain't nothin' that love can't fix
Girl, it's right here at our fingertips
So come a little closer baby,
I feel like layin' you down

Come a little closer, baby
I feel like lettin' go
Of everything that stands between us
And the love we used to know
I wanna touch you like a cleansing rain
Let it wash all the hurt away
So come a little closer baby
I feel like lettin' go

If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
Till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
Back to the basics of you and me
What makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down

Come a little closer baby
Just a little bit closer baby
Come a little closer baby
I feel like layin' you down

Cracked windshield
Crumpled up cans and a beat up bag of red man chew
Fix a flat, jonny cash box set
Half a dozen parking ickets that I ain't paid yet
Litten on that long bed seat
I got my shot gun girl right next to me

Four wheel turnin'
Two hearts burnin
We go runnin' wild
Gonna make a million
Memories for every hundred
Thousand miles
Learnin everything I'll ever need
To know about life and love
In the cab of my truck

Sliden rear
Back window
So it's an easy reach to where my cooler keeps 'em iced down cold
Roll of duck tape, W D 40
Ain't nothin' too loose or licked too tight for a man like me
Yeah, I might take it slow
30 through town
On a back dirt road
Girl I put the hammer down

Down by the river, two bodies in the glow of the radio dial
Gonna make a million memories for every hundred thousand miles
I'm learnin everything we'll ever need to know about life and love
In the cab of my truck
In the cab of my truck

Man I can't find anything in this truck
Oh, what's this? a little white tank top
Get out of my way Cadilac, big white's comin' through

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I must look just like a fool
Here in the middle of the road
Standin' there in your rearview
Gettin' soaked to the bone
This land as flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still paryin' I might see
The glow of the brake light

But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believin' you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot, on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes, baby just one time
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around
I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slowdown
I'd settle for a slowdown

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hey bartender, can I make one special request?
My woman left me, so tonight I'll be drinkin' your best.
I'm not talkin' about Single Malt, Scotch, Jagermeister, or Cuervo Gold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.

Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic.
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold.

No, I wasn't cheatin'. She just said that I was hard to please.
And I'll admit it: I can be set in my country ways.
So go ahead and break out the good stuff, if I can be so bold.
I'll take anything domestic, light, and cold.

Domestic, light, and cold, that's what I'm havin'.
Serve me up any old, iced-down American classic.
Pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, light, and cold.

You've got beer from all over the world on the wall.
I can even get a free t-shirt, if I try them all.
But tonight I'm in the mood for some of that home-grown brew!

Yeah, pop a top, crack a can, just don't make me wait too long.
I'll take, anything domestic, hey I know what the best is.
Anything domestic, light, and cold!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The world is cold but I don't care, when you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound, and good things happen when you're Around
I work hard for not much pay, so I can know that you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds, and good things happen when you're Around

So won't you wait for me, I'll be home soon
Wait for me, I'll only be a day or two

(Musical interlude)

Won't you wait for me, I'll be home soon
Yeah, Wait for me, I'll only be a day or two

The world is cold but I don't care, when you have flowers in your hair
I see color and I hear sound, and good things happen when you're around
I work hard for not much pay, so I can know that you'll be okay
'Cause I need to live where love abounds, and good things happen when you're around

Good things happen when you're around

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Guess you heard I'm doin' well
Struck it rich, to hear some folks tell
But I'm still the same old me
Down on Easy Street

You give your all to find that road
And you lose touch with some people as you go
Promises are hard to keep
Down on Easy Street

But when I lay down, and you're not there
Girl, I wish I was anywhere, but

In this world where the telephone is all I touch
When I'm alone and no one ever really knows
The man inside of me
Up here in this lonely room just a-sippin' wine
And a-missin' you girl I've got everything
But what I need
That's why I'm down
Down on Easy Street

Someone told me you moved on
Well who could blame you, with me so off and gone
But do you ever think of me
Down on Easy Street

If you're out this way, some week, some year
Girl, you'll still find me waitin' here

(Repeat Chorus Twice)

Down on Easy Street
Down on Easy Street

Guess you heard I'm doin' well

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I don't wanna rush this thing
I don't wanna jump the gun
I really wanna say those three little words
But I'm gonna bite my tongue

Yeah, I'm just gonna lay on back
Leave it on cruise control
I'm gonna hold it all inside
Till the right time comes down the road

I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an "I"
And ends with a "U"
I got a feelin'
Are you feelin' it too?

I guess I've all but said it now
So much for hopin' you'd go first
Don't leave me hangin' out here on a line
Baby, it's your turn
Say you couldn't sleep last night
Swore that you could feel me breathe
Had you wantin' me there by your side
Yeah, baby I know what you mean

I got a feelin'
My head's a reelin'
My heart is screamin'
I'm about to bust loose
Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an "I"
And ends with a "U"
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too

Bottled up emotion
It's more than a notion
It starts with an "I"
And ends with a "U"
I got a feelin'
You're feelin' it too
You're feelin' it too
Yeah, you're feelin' it too
Feelin' it too
Oh, yeah

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I prefer the fiddle to the violin
And I tend to think that supermodels are too thin
And I think who you are is who you oughtta be
But that's just me

The best of Andy Griffith was in black and white
Fishin' still beats workin' if you never get a bite
And coffee's kinda pointless without caffeine
But that's just me

And I believe in little that I hear and only half of what I see
And I believe that living by the book is harder than it used to be
And I'm convinced that lovin' you
Is gonna be the secret to my longevity
But that's just me

I've never seen a place that I like more than home
When I go to the movies, I don't take a telephone
And I'll buy the gas, but you oughtta get the air for free
But that's just me

I've never been to Mars, but I'm a man
And I accept the fact that women are just hard to understand
I think people take themselves too seriously
But that's just me

Hey, that's just me
That's just me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You're the last thing that I cling to
Before I fall asleep at night
You're the first thing that I reach for
In the early mornin' light

You're the name that I see written in the stars
You're the face that I see in every cloud
Oh, I wish you could've been more like
Your memory and kept hangin' around

You're that tap on my shoulder
You're that voice in the crowd
You're that constant distraction
You're that book I can't put down

It keeps haunting me, I still want and need you, always will
You're every thought I think, every sight I see
Every feelin' I feel

You're the last thing that I wish for
When I lay down at night

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Well, we know it ain't the first time
We know it used to be my past time
And a couple of weeks back we agreed
That was gonna be my last time
But I guess that night I plumb forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not

Oh, I musta been off my rocker
I musta got some wires crossed
To come in here claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh, it musta been me the big talker
Had a little too much Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker

No, there ain't no need to stay mad
No need to waste a whole day mad
Thought I have to admit, honey, you
Look pretty darn cute mad
Oh baby, workin' this out can't be that hard
I said I'm gonna be in charge?

Oh, I musta been off my rocker
I musta got some wires crossed
To come in here claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh, it musta been me the big talker
Had a little too much Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker

Oh, burn it down now

Yeah, I guess last night I plumb forgot
Who's runnin' this show and who's not

Oh, I musta been off my rocker
I musta got some wires crossed
To come in here claimin' that from here on out
I'm gonna be the boss
Oh, it musta been me the big talker
Had a little too much Johnny Walker
So let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker

Yeah, let's forget about it baby, I musta been off my rocker
Ah, I'm sorry about that baby

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I remember lookin' up to look up to him.
An' I remember, most the time he wasn't there.
I'd be waitin' at the door when he got home at night.
He'd pass me by to go pass out in his chair. 

An' I'd say: "Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
I keep trippin' an' stumblin'.
If you'd look down here, you'd see:
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me." 

He stumbled in the gym on graduation day.
An' I couldn't help but feel so ashamed.
An' I wasn't surprised a bit when he didn't stay,
He stumbled out before they called my name. 

An' I thought:"Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
It's not just me who's watching,
You've caught everybody's eye.
And you're trippin' an' stumblin',
And even though I've turned eighteen,
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're still leading me." 

The old man's still like he always was,
But I love him anyway.
If I've learned one thing from him,
It's my kids will never have to say: 

"Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're swayin', side to side.
Your footsteps make me dizzy,
And no matter how I try,
I keep trippin' an' stumblin'.
If you'd look down here, you'd see:
Walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me." 

"Yeah, walk a little straighter, Daddy,
You're leading me."

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Well, here we are again
Me and my friends on a Friday night
Waitin' on Jimmy
He's always gotta get his hair just right
Bobby yells. "Where we gonna go?"
Oh, you'd think by now he'd know

Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are

Pile three in my truck
The rest follow us, and we'll head downtown
Ah, y'all know the drill, hit Jack and Jill's
Then the Cavalier Lounge
Jimmy, you run in and look around
And we'll know if you don't come out, that's

Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are

If we gotta cross the county line
Oh, you can bet we're gonna find

Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are

Where the girls are
Where the fun is
Where the heads get turned and games begin
Might get you a name and a number
Kiss and a hug
Where the girls are

Where the girls
Where the girls
Whoo, I think we done hit the goldmine

Billy Currington - Time with you

Daily time is stealin me away again
But I just want to lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now is

Time with you
More time with you
To laugh and talk and play
And to make more love to you...
Oh there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Than spend time with you... ooh

Seven days you and me in paradise
The world revolvin around us
We'd still be there and forever
If the choice was mine
'Cause seven days that's not enough

I'm gone for now
To do the things I have to do
But baby you know I live for you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Like a summer breeze floatin' cross the water
Softer than a whisper on my skin
I can't begin to tell you how it moves me
It's so intense, I burn within

When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me

She walks across the room just like an angel
And I get that funny feeling deep inside
Pulls up a chair and sits down at the table
I come to life, oh, there's nothin' like

When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me

Oh, no one has ever touched me like this
Set me on fire with just one sweet gentle kiss
Amazing, that's what is is

When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me

Anywhere close to me
When she gets close to me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The red Georgia clay when mixed with the rain
Sure made for one nasty mess
Ah, but we were ridin' high in that old truck of mine
In deep as we could get
Always looking for a rut, tryin' not to get stuck
And slinging that mud everywhere, growin' up down there

Me and my friends where the deep river bends
Had a long rope tied to a tree
Takin' turns on the swing, takin' turns takin' drinks
And I don't mean iced tea
A good buzz later playing chicken with the gators
Way too young to be scared, growin' up down there

And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second, I swear
Well. I'd still be growin' up down there

We'll, nothin' going on never lasted too long
We were good at makin' good times
Find a field, spread the word, keep a bonfire burnin'
Through both ends of the night
Had the radio up, had a keg in the truck
And tryin' to get lucky somewhere
Growin' up down there

And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second, I swear
Well. I'd still be growin' up down there

And those tan little peaches turnin' us on
Keepin' things hot all summer long
If I could go back in a second, I swear
Well. I'd still be growin' up down there

Yeah, lookin' back now, man, it don't seem fair
If you didn't get to do your growin' up down there

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

So, there's somewhere you gotta be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave
I'll break my grip, but babe, you need to know
Next time I might not let you go

I know what you said
And I wanted that too
But takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do
It's feelin' more and more like forever
Holdin' you close
And next time I might not let you go

Good thing I don't get paid to think
'Cause I sure thought I had the strength
To fight love off, but my resistance is runnin' low
And next time I might not let you go

I know what you said
And I wanted that too
But takin' it slow is gettin' harder to do
It's feelin' more and more like forever
Holdin' you close
And next time I might not let you go

Yeah, next time I just might
Hold on for dear life

Yeah, next time I just might not let you go
Next time I might not let you go

So, there's somewhere you gotta be
Well, I sure hate to see you leave

That backward town in my rearview
Was gonna be my whole world
Till my factory job got shipped to Mexico
And a city boy stole my sweet girl

I used to know everybody by name
Everybody's moved away
Can't say that I'm really wantin' to go
But I've run out of reasons to stay

This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be

I thought like my dad and his daddy before
That I would die where I was born
Live in a small town dream in a big backyard
Raisin' babies and corn

Now here I am, one eye on the road
Tryin' to read the map on the dash
Nowhere close to making up my mind
With a fork in the road comin' fast

This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be

This ain't nothin' like what I
Had in mind for me
But then again my future
Ain't what it used to be

That backward town in my rearview
Was gonna be my whole world

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.

City folks got worries,
A country boy's got none
All I wanna be is the daddy of a farmer's son
Subdivisions are silly, I wanna be a hillbilly.

I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.

When I get finished plowin'
I'm gonna go to the pond
And take my sweet baby
And have some good clean fun
You gotta work, that's a pity
I'm gonna be a hillbilly.

I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.
When I die, throw me a big fine wake
And have a party in the barn
Let me lie in state
Plant me under that oak tree
I wanna be a hillbilly

I wanna be a hillbilly, prayin' for the rain
Drink corn whiskey, raise a little cane
You can have the big city, I wanna be a hillbilly.

Subdivisions are silly
I wanna be a hillbilly.

I was sittin' there, sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from

She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the interstate
Needin' directions, and I was the man for the job

I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Ms. Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate, but a right
Will bring you right back here to me

I was sittin' at thinkin' 'bout her pretty face
Kickin' myself for not catchin' her name
I threw my hat and thought you fool, it could've been love

I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Ms. Bell for some of her sweet tea

Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right
Will bring ya right back here to me

Is this Georgia heat, playin' tricks on me
Or am I really seein' what I think I see
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me

She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why but somethin' felt right
You gotta stop in and asked Ms. Bell for some of her sweet tea

Mama gave her a big 'ol glass and sent 'er right back here to me
Thank God, for good directions, and turnip greens

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you gotta take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong

Must be doin' something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right

Anywhere you wanna go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

Must be doin' something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right

Oh, baby
Mmm...

I don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right, oh yeah
Must be doin' something right
Must be doin' something right
Mmm...

Don't know what I did
Oh...

I've been your lover, I've been your friend
I've been your faithful one-woman man
I've been your diamond in the rough
Now you say you wanna polish me up

Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now

I remember you used to like
Walkin' with me on my wilder side
My kind of crazy turned you on
Do you really want that part of me gone?

Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now

Why, why, why
Ain't I the one?

Why, why, why do you wanna change me now?
Ain't I the one you loved everything about?
You might start missin' the old me around
So why, why, why do you wanna change me now

I said, "I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston"
I've been thinkin' I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinkin' that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me

And that changes everything
That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything

Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pullin' up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinkin', "Who am I kiddin'?"
I ain't goin' nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me

And that changes everything
That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing that changes everything

That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
That changes everything
Ah, yeah

Well, I parked my car in the driveway
Somewhere around 1 am
Worn out from the road with a big heavy load
On my mind, what a week it had been
Then I stumbled into the kitchen
And I saw that little red light
Blinkin' at me from my message machine
Then I knew it would be all right
'Cause she said

"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"

Now it didn't take me a second till I knew
The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said "Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two."
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine
She don't call me much but I know when she does
That I'm in for one helluva time
When she says,

"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Baby, baby, baby just for tonight
Be my one and only
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely

Yeah everybody needs a little love sometimes
Yeah, who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby, not tonight
No, no, no, no
Not tonight, now baby

"Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight
I'm a little bit lonely"
Baby, baby just come hold me tight
You don't have to call me
Baby, baby, baby come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely
I'm lonely, lonely, lonely
So come on baby
Said, "I'll be there in a minute or two."
And I brought those daises and that red wine
We had one hell of a time
Yeah, yeah, yeah

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's a gentle touch, but more than enough
She can stop this ole world from spinnin' too much
It's a natural thing and I do believe
I found my reason to be

She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

I'm not the same man since she's been around
There's more to this life, I've suddenly found
I look at myself now so differently
It's her love that brings me peace

She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

Whatever it is, I'll always be under her spell
She'll always be all I'll ever need
I could search the whole world
And I know I'd never find
Someone perfect as her for me

Suddenly it's something
You just can't live without
Oh, you know you found love
Beyond any doubt
With a simple man's words
I can never convey all that I feel when I say

She's got a way with me
She's got a way with me

She's got a way with me
(She's got a way with me)

In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot,
On a barstool she took off her ring.
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over.
I sat down and asked her her name.
When the drinks finally hit her,
She said," I'm no quitter,
But I finally quit living on dreams.
I'm hungry for laughter,
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings."

In the mirror I saw him,
And I closely watched him.
I thought how he looked out of place.
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me.
He had a strange look on his face.
The big hands were calloused,
He looked like a mountain,
For a minute I thought I was dead.
But he started shaking,
His big heart was breaking,
He turned to the woman and said,

"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.

After he left us, I ordered more whiskey.
I thought how she'd made him look small.
From the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all.
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind.
I couldn't hold her, for the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time.

"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.

"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field.
I've had some bad times,
I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.

Sure feels good, sure feels right
Sure enough feels like love tonight
Ain't no movie, ain't no bar
Ain't nothin' out there beats where we are

Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

We've been workin' so hard, had no breaks
Gotta lotta overdue love to make
If we get no sleep, well that's okay
'Bout time me and you and me got this way

Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

Well, come on baby, we can't stop now
No givin' in till we both give out

Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

We're just getting' started, ain't this fun
There's a whole lot more where that came from
Yeah, there's a whole lot more where that came from
Oh yeah

Walks in the rain, talks in the dark
Old black and white movies, a day at the park
On a blanket on the ground on a Sunday afternoon
Hangin' with friends or off by ourselves
Drivin' around yard sale to yard sale
Droppin' by the county fair, winnin' you a bear poppin' balloons

If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am

December nights all cuddled up
Warmed by the fire and sharin' a cup
Of hot cocoa laughin' at old photos
Spanish guitars, sand and the sea
A quiet little table just you and me
Sippin' margaritas in a little cantina in Old Mexico

If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am

Talkin' 'bout life and talkin' 'bout babies
Talkin' 'bout us still in love when we're eighty

If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am

Here I am
Baby, here I am

She don't cook, she don't clean
She ain't never found the knob on the washin' machine
She don't iron, she don't sew
Says why waste time, foldin' clothes
She ain't never gonna get Mama's recipe right
But she knows what to do with a Saturday night

Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber neckin', tryin' to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

She makes a mean margarita and a Singapore Sling
And if y'all are into Skynard, she sure can sing
She's gonna run the table, if you let her break
She might pop out of the top of a birthday cake
And that little black dress painted on tight
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

Hit every hot spot all around town
Turn it on up, she'll tear it on down
People rubber neckin', tryin' to see her dance
She got a belly button ring and some low-rider pants
They call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

We get home in the early a.m.
That's when all the real fun begins
Yeah, she holds me close and whispers in my ear
Every little sweet thing I want to hear

Then she lights them candles and out go the lights
She knows what to do with a Saturday night

Yeah, they call me lucky, I know that's right
She knows what to do with a Saturday night
Saturday night
With a Saturday night
Saturday night

I only slept for a couple of hours
In the back of my buddy's truck
I must be runnin' on solar power
'Cause I'm ready to crank back up

And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine

There's a hole in my beach towel
There's a hole in the atmosphere
But we got the shade of the lifeguard tower
Yeah, that's where we keep the beer

And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky

My baby says "Hey I think I wanna get wet"
So we hots and hop into the waters' edge
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
Havin' a good time
Swimmin' in sunshine

Yeah I know Monday always comes again
So I just wanna soak it in

And the boys are all bangin' on cheap guitars
And the girls are all rockin' their bikini tops
And that big ball's way up in the sky
My baby's into lockin' in a Coppertone tan
So I'm so emotional she did with both of my hands
Hey, it's so good to be alive
Swimmin' in sunshine
Swimmin' in sunshine
Havin' a good time
Swimmin' in sunshine

La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da da da
Swimmin' in sunshine

Well I never thought that I'd be where I'm at
At this point in my life looking back
My old heart's been broken more than I can count
And my plans aren't going like I've worked 'em out

I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of

Well I posed my questions and got no reply
Maybe God's just saying why ask why
And I think how boring this old life would be if we had the answers to everything

I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of

That's the beauty of it
If I don't solve nothing
I can try again
Another day is coming I should be on to something really good by then

I think I might just stay up late gazing up at the stars above
Laying around and contemplate, life and love and the meaning of

I think I just might spend the day looking up at the clouds above
Laying around and contemplate life and love and the meaning of

Every reason not to go
I don't think you'll like it
I hear that city's cold
And the people are much warmer
Two good reasons not to go
You fight traffic all day long
Then you gotta pay to park
You have to go around locking all your doors there after dark

Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go

Their football team is lousy
No matter what they do
You can bet come Sunday they'll find a way to lose
You'll hate the way the smoke and the buildings block the sky
Got the prices jacked so high takes a million to get by

Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
If you let me I can give you don't you know
Every reason not to go

There must be something in this town
You'd be missing if you move
'Cause I know if you weren't around I'd be missing you

Don't know why you feel you gotta go somewhere
Have you ever thought about just saying here
I'm in love with you
And baby now you know every reason not to go

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Don't you hate hearing that clock on the wall chimming saying its time and
Don't you just wish we could stay right here together all day long
You know it wouldn't be a crime if we crawled back into bed got as close as we could get
Tried to figure out where this thing is going

Baby, b'aby, don't, don't you say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

If you gotta go you gotta know I might go crazy
Here without you baby
Reliving every kiss, you ain't leaving me like this
It just ain't right and wait until tonight to light another flame
You know it wouldn't be the same as the fire we got burning this morning

Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

No, No one else can love me like you do
You know I ain't even close to through
Loving you...

Baby, baby, don't, don't you say you're leaving
Why don't you stay a little bit longer
Got it going on and I just can't believe it
This feeling it just keeps getting stronger

This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
"God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy"

He said "I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "Damn if I know"
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said "These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"

Last call its 2:00am
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page Obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

The way you stumble in the kitchen
Looking for that first cup of joe
How you put on your mascara
Starin' in the mirror on your tippy-toes
And if you wonder why I love you baby
I can boil it down to just one thing

Yeah everything
Every little thing about you baby turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
I can't explain
How everything about you turns me on
(If it ain't one thing it's another)
Oh it turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on

The sexy way you say "Hey baby"
When you see my number on your phone
The way you bit your lip when Mama said
"You cooked the chicken way too long"
Girl be careful what you do and say

The way you walk, the way you smile
The way you kiss, it drives me wild
The way you laugh, the way you sing
Girl you know it's everything
The way you talk, the way you drive
The way you make me feel alive
The way you whisper "I love you"
Everything you do just turns me on, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on
On, on, on

You're a modern day miracle
Anything but a typical girl
Mona Lisa on a sidewalk stand
Superstar in a common man world
Nothing's been so beautiful

Wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on

I know I've seen you somewhere before
In my mind behind door number 3
You're a pray you're a gift from god
But there's a bridge I cannot cross
It seems your distant dream
I will never hold you

I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on

I put one foot in front of another
I walk on
Knowing there will never be another

I wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I wanna beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
But instead I catch my breath, shake my head, and I walk on
I walk on

Sometimes they look brown
Sometimes they look blue
Always they offer a beautiful view
Into the soul I'm connected to
No one has eyes like you

They dance in the light
They sing in the dark
They pull me together
They tear me apart
I'm jealous of paper when you read the news
Oh no one has eyes like you

They hold me, they know me
Like no one will ever know me
They fly me
They land me
Most of all they understand me

They shout hallelujah when you whisper my name
Patiently listen to whatever I say
They playful and funny
And passionate too
No one has eyes like you

They hold me, and they know me
Like no one will ever know me
And They fly me
And They land me
Most of all they understand me

They smile when I'm happy
They cry when I'm sad
They make me out to be more than I am
Oh no one loves me more than you do
And no one has eyes like you
Oh no one has eyes baby like you

I got the chrome all shined up.
Look how the moon just climbed up.
Who knows where we'll wind up, ooh.
A finger hangin' on your belt look,
Finger flippin' for the right tune.
You know how bad I want you, ooh.
Oh, I hope that you likin' how I handle the curves.
I can't think straight and I'm startin' to swerve so...

Let's go. No more drivin' around in circles, let's roll.
I could show you my moves while we're headlights ends,
And brake lights burnin' like a Cuban cigar.
Sittin' by the tree in your neighbor's yard
Or outside of town where the wild things are.
Just tell me where to park, tell me where to park,
Tell me where to park, tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.

We don't need a drop of gasoline,
Settin' off sparks in the passenger seat.
You can write your name in the window steam, ooh.
We can hit a hundred standin' still,
Barely hangin' on on the top of a hill.
Slidin' on the hood, kickin' off your heels, ooh.

Come on let's go. No more drivin' around in circles, let's roll.
I could show you my moves while we're headlights ends,
And brake lights burnin' like a Cuban cigar.
Sittin' by the tree in your neighbor's yard
Or outside of town where the wild things are.
Just tell me where to park, tell me where to park,
Tell me where to park, tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.

Well we still got time fore the moon runs
Out to find what these hearts are beatin' about so...

Let's go. No more drivin' around in circles, let's roll.
I could show you my moves while we're headlights ends,
And brake lights burnin' like a Cuban cigar.
Sittin' by the tree in your neighbor's yard
Or outside of town where the wild things are.
Just tell me where to park, tell me where to park,
Tell me where to park, tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.

Tell me where to park, just tell me where to park.

It happened on a Sunday,
Outside and the sun was shinning.
That look on your face
Oh it hit me so hard inside.
I could see how the light was fading
From your pretty blue eyes and
All I needed were the right words,
But they were so hard to find.

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us

I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love

I kissed your tears all falling down
Said baby, you'll always be the one
Aw baby I'm never going to turn around
Your all the life I have in these lungs

We can all be scared to death
Never certain of what it is we want
All the fears we should confess
Holding our breath just dying to speak up

In a second my world changed
So fast that my heart was breaking
I wrapped my arms around you
And I just kept saying your name
I put your hands in my hands
And we dropped to the floor board crying
At the moment your heart gave up on us

I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I remember that night at your mamas house
We were so in love, finally said it out loud
I got down on my knees,
Said you're the best thing that ever happened to me
You walking down the isle,
I remember it now,
I remember your smile

I told you,
Ill bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
I will, bring you back, ill bring you back,
Ill bring you back to love
Yaaaaaaa
Ill bring you back to love
Ill bring you back to love

People say I'm a little shy and I keep to myself

I ain't much for small talking
Don't wanna waste my breath
Everything we've been saying has already been said,
Politics and weather well I'm out
But when someone brings you up, there ain't no shuttin my mouth

I go on and on talkin' 'bout you baby
All day long, your name it just rolls so easy off my tongue
That I can't help but go on and on and on and on and on

Those baby blues and the way you move have got me losin my mind
Just can't help myself don't wanna talk about nothin' else
The only conversation we're conversating about
When once you get me going there ain't no slowin me down

Put me on a one-way runway sky-high aeroplane

One Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading
I see your already gone
Half of who I used to be, one Mississippi

Lipstick on the coffee cup
I know I should wash it up
But maybe I'll just wait here for a little while
I run my fingers around the top
Where your lips were I just stop
'Cause I, I can almost see your smile

And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn

And I know everybody's got their demons
Everybody's got their reasons
Why they leave when they run
Oh but baby I could have helped you through it
You built a wall and I couldn't get to it
Now I'm waiting for the rain, and the pain to come

And it's one Mississippi, two Mississippi
Counting down the seconds
Standing in the wreckage of love
On a cold grey Jackson dawn
Oh I just can't watch this, sure can't stop this
I keep waiting, your tail lights are fading
I see your already gone
Half of who I used to be, one Mississippi

Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance

Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey

Cause you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
The beat of the music

I think I could get used to that steel drum playing
Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying
One more night would be more than alright with me
So hold on baby cause

You got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music
We're falling in love to beat of the music
Beat of the music

I got my hands in my pockets 'cause it's been a cold walk home
I'm still a little shocked that you don't want me anymore
I was so foolish thinkin' you'd be
Happy just sittin' round waitin' on me
It really put me in my place
When you closed the door in my face

And I
I sure spent a lot of time
All makin' up my mind
Once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah
I guess I waited too long

I could beg, I could cry but it won't change the circumstance
Cause the truth is I should've pulled the trigger when I had the chance
I was looking for something I already had
When I came back for it it was somebody else's
You used to give me all your lovin'
But now you say you've had enough

And I
I sure spent a lot of time
Oh makin' up my mind
Once I finally figured out where I belong
I waited too long
Yeah
I guess I waited too long

Oh waited, I waited

I got my hands in my pockets 'cause it's been a cold walk home
I'm still a little shocked that you don't want me anymore

And I
Sure spent a lot of time
Oh makin' up my mind
And once I finally figured out where I belong
Yeah once I finally figured out where I belong

If I could be the reason your hair's a mess,
The bass drum beatin' way down deep in your chest,
If I could be the voice on your radio,
Then I could be your long ride home.

If mine could be the name that changes yours,
The wine in your glass,
The swing on your porch,
The dollar in your pocket,
And the peaceful in your sleep,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

If I could be the fire in your firefly,
The cool in the rain,
The spark in your eye,
The answer to your prayer,
And the faith that sets you free,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me,
What you mean to me

And oh,
All of this talkin' makes you laugh,
But I've gotta let you know just how I'm feeling while I'm
Standing here,
Watching you,
Turning every head in this crowded room,
The lights down low,
Dancin slow,
Oh, if falling's how you feel,
And perfect is what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.

Yeah,
Falling's how you feel,
And perfect's what you see,
Then I'd be what you mean to me.
Be what you mean to me.
Oh, be what you mean, what you mean, what you mean, what you mean to me.

Welcome to Paris, home of the Tigers

Well, congratulations Bobby and Amber
God bless the newlyweds
There's a graveside service in the morning
For our dear miss Mildred

The VFW's got a bingo night
Motel 6 has got a burn out light
The demo derby at the county fair
It's all right there in the

Signs tellin' you a story
Paintin' you a picture in black and white
Life comin' at you slowly
Hits you in the heart, not just the eyes
If you wanna know what's goin' on in this little town
All you gotta do is read the signs

Well Johnny broke up with Deborah Davis
She's the quick stop clerk
She got a ladder and changed all the letters
Spelled out: "Johnny is a jerk"

Sheriff Grady's sure runnin' hard
He's got his name and his picture in every yard
Nobody's run against him since '83
He just likes to read the

Coming home at last

If you wanna know what's goin' on in a little town
All you gotta do is read the signs
Yeah, read the signs

Oh yeah, read the signs
Yeah, read the signs

I work down at Ashbury Hills
Minimum wage but it pays the bills
Cleanin' floors and leading hymns on Sunday

Katherine Davis, room 303
Sweetest soul you ever could meet
I bring her morning coffee everyday

She calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
Before your daddy gets home

She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me

She talks about clothes on the line in the summer air
Christmas morning and Thanksgiving prayer
And stories of a family that I never had
Well, sometimes I find myself wishing I'd been there

When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
Before your daddy gets home

She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me

There's a small white cross in Arlington
Reads Raymond Davis '71
Until she can see his face again
I'm gonna fill in the best I can

When she calls me Raymond
She thinks I'm her son
Tells me get washed up for supper
Before your daddy gets home

She goes on about the weather
How she can't believe it's already 1943
She calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me

And she calls me Raymond
And that's all right by me

Every man has his place in time 
Everyone has a loved one that they leave behind 
And even though I'm not right there with you 
I'm watchin' from a distance, just wishin' that you knew 

I always hear the prayers in your head late at night 
I'm walkin' right beside you when nobody's by your side 
I don't want you to cry over my memory 
So go-o-o o-o-on without me 
Without me 

I hope that it's my love that makes you feel 
That you can get back on your feet, yeah I swear you will 
Oh you got so much of this life left to live 
And I'll be smilin' at the thought of you, just like I always did 

I always hear the prayers in your head late at night 
I'm walkin' right beside you when nobody's by your side 
I don't want you to cry over my memory 
So go-o-o o-o-on without me 
Without me 
Without me 
Without me 
Yeah 

I always hear the prayers in your head late at night 
I'm walkin' right beside you when nobody's by your side 
I don't want you to cry over my memory 
So go-o-o o-o-on without me 
Without me 

Every breath of life is short and sweet 
So glad that I'm up here, that I got to see 
You g-o-o o-o-on without me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You look good in the palm of my hands
Watch the light round your feet just dance
Feel your sweat pressed against my skin
Girl you're fire, you're fire
Take the breath right out of my chest
Burn me down till there ain't nothing left
Keep on doing what you do best
Girl you're fire, you're fire

There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, you're fire, oh
Bring the heat

You're like a mess lying across that floor
Every step makes me want you more
Oh and you thought I wanted you before
Well girl you're fire, you're fire

There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, oh

Ridin' those eyes covered in smoke
Face is red as a dirty joke
Shakin' those hips, lickin' those lips
Doin' what you do to get the whole room lit

There you go sliding your hand in my pocket
Lighting me up and I kinda like it
I know, oh oh oh
I know, oh oh oh
Here I am breaking into a cold hot sweat
You ain't even got started yet
I know, oh oh oh
You don't even know, oh oh oh
You're fire, you're fire
You're fire, you're fire, oh
Yeah

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Wall to wall, it's packed
Give your hands a smack
Polish up my watch 
VIP is in the back
Hear the beat of the music playing
Rat pack, hi-hat swaying
I'll blaze it up and braise it
I'm saying

Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't

Oh no, the goose is loose
Just feeling up this groove
Don't it feel nice
Burning up these lights
Those green eyes, I've been watching
Got me all caught up and
The way your hips are talking
I can't stop it

Just like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't

Bring the heat back
I could party with you, you could party with me
If you party with us, then you better believe
That the lights are up in this town
But they're about, about to go down
And it's about midnight
Oh, and I think she might
Told her to spin around, all around this town

Feels like the roof is on fire
So turn up the heat
All my friends are here
But the drinks on me
Pretty girls around
Everywhere you look
It's right on my face
You can say I'm hooked on
This crazy life I'm living
This crazy love I'm giving
Sit back, just watch, you'll see
You can try but you can't stop me
You can't stop me
No, you can't

You put me on a roller coaster, fly me on a plane
You send me to another planet, get inside my brain
I knew right when I met you I would never be the same
But I let you take me over, girl, so I'm the one to blame, oh

You... make all my screws come... loose
Got me perfectly con... fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Lose my mind

You make me crazy and I kinda like it
You show me that apple, girl, and I wanna bite it
So crazy that I gotta have it
And I never wanna get out of this straitjacket

You... make all my screws come... loose
Got me perfectly con... fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my...

I feel the walls closing in inside this padded room
Only good thing about it is I'm locked in here with you, yeah
I'm always watching you, wondering what you'll do next
But my favorite part about it is I always have to guess (you know I do)

You... you make all my screws come... loose
Got me perfectly con... fused
Always find a way to mess me up and drive me wild
I love the way you make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Make me lose my mind
Lose my mind

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The radio and a sundress
Making my world all a mess
Back corner of a cornfield
Bottle tops and a true spear
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of that moon

I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna

When you're searching the horizon
When you're eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack

Oh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh, I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be, yeah, oh.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I've been racing, chasing, caught up in the grind
Damn near going out of my mind
And it's getting old real fast
I need a new time zone, zip code, point of view
A southbound window seat into (come fly with me)
A drunken rum-soaked crowd

And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of work, and it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent

I got all I need
Floating on the breeze in Staniel Cay
The pounding in my head's starting to ease
From the magic in this glass
Yeah, that's the way it works down here
Things turn around real fast

And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of work, and it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent

You can get a little loud
We can get a little hard to find
Give a little bit of love
We'll mix it with a bit of sunshine
Mix it up

And here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
The bottom of the bottle seems so far
So come on, let's dive back in
'Cause I'm tired of work, and it's time to play
Where I stumble's where I've stayed
If palm tree shade makes a perfect tent
Then wasted time is time well spent

You gotta waste a little time in your life once in a while
Come on everybody
Ah, here we are
Strangers, barefoot dancing on the bar
Fill 'er up again
It's time well spent, it's time well spent
It's time well spent, it's time well spent

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You light up every street light
You stop every heart when you start that smile
But somehow you're still lonely
Oh let me show you why you're the only one I wanna give my heart to
If you give me the chance, oh I'll show you it's alright
Oh watch your life

To pick you up, I'd lay you down
I'd hold you 'til you come unwound
I'd make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
Ah, if you were my girl
If you were my girl

You wouldn't be staring at the ceiling
With a half broke heart wondering if that feeling is ever
Going to fade away
I'd change all that if you let me today
'Cause I've never wanted anything
The way I want you next to me
For all my life
Come on let's ride

I'll pick you up, I'll lay you down
I'd hold you 'til you come unwound
I'd make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
Ah, if you were my girl
If you were my girl

For the first time maybe ever, who am I kidding
Girl I've never felt the way I feel, oh it's so real

Let me pick you up, and lay you down
Hold you 'til you come unwound
I'll make you feel like you're all I need
In this whole world
If you were my girl

If you were my girl
If you were, if you were my girl
If you were my girl
Oh if you were, if you were my girl
If you were, if you were my girl

I come from the heart of the Heartland
Where pictures shows where the corn grows
In rows and rows of summer greens
And winter snows
And it goes on
Through the crack of the bat
Oh everybody rollin' out there welcome mat
And our hands on our hearts under the stars of the Friday night flag

And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois

I remember the first time 
I saw that name on the marquee sign
Lights so bright could almost make you blind
I'd get lost in
Sweet girls singin' along
Buses rollin' on in the silver dawn
Seein' the world a long long way from home

And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh...

It's water through my blood
It's the place I got my roots
It's the fire that's in my soul
It's the mud that's on my boots

Ooh Illinois...

And oh the heart will wander
Beyond that wild blue yonder
When I get lost in the noise 
Like a whisper I hear the voice of the boy
Oh from Illinois

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

All I can do is try to drink you in
And do my best
To soak up all that sugar from your skin
But then you had to go and kiss me
You made me fall a little bit harder in this age
You gonna have to miss me
Oh, what do you got to do that for your lips

Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste
Just a taste

I'd love to run my fingers through your head
We could just pick up
Where we left off and start right there, hell I don't care
Oh, tell me what's your secret
Or how'd you get me going all crazy like this
And you got the touch and I need it
And I'm thinking you know that I can't resist your lips

Pressed to my lips
Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was

Now all I do
Is think about you all the time
But let me show you
That you never felt a love like mine
No you never felt a love like mine

All you left me was
Your lips pressed to my lips

Oh, in my mind I keep
Replaying it
Over and over but that's how
I found that you're my favorite flavor
But all you left me was
Just a taste, yeah
Just a taste, yeah
Back in my mind all the time
Just a taste
So good on that sugar from your skin
Oh, I gotta drink you in
Oh, let me drink you in
Just a taste

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

The second she walked through the door, I caught a buzz
One taste from your lips knocked me out just like a drug
The rest of the night's kind of blurry
Now the sun's peeking through the shades
I can't help but laugh 'cause I kind of like feeling this way

I woke up, up 
Still drunk, drunk
On your love, love
On your love, love, love
Now I know why-y
Feeling so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk 
On your love, on your love

It's not in the whiskey, tequila or the wine
It's all about the touch and the fire in your eyes
It gets me fumbling always stumbling through a haze
I got plenty to do, just laying here with you all day

I woke up, up 
Still drunk, drunk
On your love, love
On your love, love, love
Now I know why-y
Feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk 
On your love, on your love

Wish I could bottle you up and drink you in all day long
Every day singing this song

I woke up, up 
Still drunk, drunk
On your love, love
On your love, love, love
Now I know why-y
Feelin' so high, high
Cause I'm still drunk, drunk 
On your love, on your love

(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
(Woke up still drunk on your love)
On your love
Still drunk on your love
Yeah, yeah
I'm so drunk

First you gotta learn how not to listen
When she opens up her heart
Try your best to make it all about you
That's the easy part

Take all your promises, and break 'em
Stay out late, and come home high
And by this time you're on your way
It's gonna be over any day
And if you've really tried
You won't have to wonder why

Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard, and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
Ignore the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all

Let the walls fall down around you
Let the bills and the dishes stack up to the sky
Make friends with regret
And try your damnedest to forget
And you bet, you never will
Oh I swear, you never will

Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard, and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
Ignore the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all

Take it from a man who knows
Just how to break a heart
Listen hard, and listen close
I got it down to an art
Keep on thinkin' she won't leave
Ignore the writing on the wall
That's how you lose it all

You lose it all
Take all your promises, and break 'em

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I got a shadow and it follows me around
Wherever I go, it moves without a sound
My alter ego, that hunts me down and gets me
Finds a way to trick me
Then drowns me in the whiskey
Hold up, I need some help
The more you feed the beast, the more he raises hell
I know, I got a problem
But you know what they say
Smoke 'em if you got 'em

Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone too far
I'm standing up here dancing on the bar
There's no denying
He came uninvited
But I kinda like him, oh no

Find me a preacher, I'm down on my knees
I need a leader to break these chains off of me
Don't let 'em hurt me, I'm getting kind of worried
Vision's getting blurry, please, somebody hurry

Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone too far
I'm standing up here dancing on the bar
There's no denying
He came uninvited
But I kinda like him, oh no

Pretty little angel, whisper in my ear
Please just make him disappear
I don't know if I can take no more

Feeling good
Probably better than I should
It's gone too far
I'm standing up here dancing on the bar
There's no denying
He came uninvited
But I kinda like him, oh no

Gotta wait for that sun to go down
He's following me around
But it gets worse at night
Alright, give me another drink, c'mon

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm going away for a while
Don't care how many miles
It takes it get wherever I go
As long as I can take it slow
And take my time
Finding a brand new heart
Making a brand new start
Been watching the whole world
Fall apart and the pieces
Keep on breaking, so

If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile

I'll be kicked back in the shade
Nothing but buzz in my veins
Nobody knowing my name
I'm just a face and a place
A dot on the map
And it's too short of a life
I gotta enjoy the ride
I finally get to feeling alive
I'm taking off, I'm flying

If I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile

And just outside this bar
There's a shop with a postcard
I'll write your name
"Wish You Were Here"
And I'll be back when things are clearer

So I go on down this road
Hand out the window
Singing every song I love
Find me a boat, a plane
A take me home country road rain
Don't worry, I'm going away for a while
But I'll come back with a smile

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don't ever wanna move

You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in my knees
You put me right where I'm supposed to be
In your blue-eyed sea
And I wanna sail away

'Cause when I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

You knock me out kiss by kiss
I need you baby, sip by sip
Sit back and let me drink you in
I'm falling to you
Over and over and over again

When I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone

Everywhere I want to go and
Everywhere I want to be at
Everywhere I've ever been
Everything I'll ever need
Is sitting right here next to me

When I wake up in the middle of the night
You're holding me so tight
Take whole of me, my oh my
Sure feels good to love someone
When you laugh at the way I dance
When you smile when you hold my hand
I look at you and I understand
Sure feels good to love someone
Sure feels good

See that girl there tapping her toes?
Nervous, crying out "Hallelujah"
She wipes her tears on the sleeve of her coat
Dries her eyes, but spills a cherry cola

I bet some guy gave her that frown
I'd love to turn it around

Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero

It's like her hands are up, out of a smoky window
Saying, "Save me from this burning building"
It's like she's cornered in a darkened alley
Helpless in a world full of villains

She's tired of running away
Here I come to save the day

Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero

That girl needs a superhero
That girl needs a superhero
Oh, I'm stepping in, I'm stepping in
I'm stepping in

Oh, that girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero
That girl needs a superhero
Walk up to her, pull her in real close
Her broken heart ain't a thing no more
That girl needs a superhero

That girl needs a superhero
Everybody needs a superhero
All the world needs a superhero

Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you got it all together
So if you don't, mind I'd like to know you better

Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive

Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been

Take me the long way around your town
Where you the queen with the silver crown
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Sitting at the bar, telling fairy tales
Pouring whiskey in wishing wells, feeling sorry for myself
There's only one person in this world that can save me from myself
So I pick up the phone, pray that you're home, I'm all alone

Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad

There's some jerk at the bar smoking a big fat Cuban cigar
And I wave my hands through the smoke
I think I see you, but it's some kind of twisted joke
Oh, you wouldn't be caught dead in here
Just the thought of me crying would make you disappear

Saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad, so damn bad

I want a choir to sing

I'm saying the reason I called you drunk
Is I need your love so bad, so bad it hurts
Baby, it's worth saying the reason I stay messed up
Is I need your love so bad, so bad, so damn bad

Girl, you're the reason
Yeah, you're the reason
You know you're the reason
I need you so bad
Girl, you're the reason
Yeah, you're the reason
You know you're the reason
I need you so bad
I need you so bad

I'm a real bad liar, I'm a burnt toast kinda guy
And if I try to build a fire I'll burn the woods
I ain't a mover or a shaker, can't keep up with the pacer
Never met a dancefloor that ever did me any good

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

I got a poor sense of direction, sometimes too strong of affection
For a whiskey made in Lynchburg, Tennessee
If there's a hole in my boat son, you bet that's all she wrote
I'm a Titanic sinking down into that deep blue sea

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm good at

Damn you're looker
You're the cane and the sugar
Jiffy Pop in the cooker
You're the author of the book
That I'm reading
You're the moon, you're the sky
You're the apple of my eye
Make me laugh till I cry
Till I think I'm gonna die
Turn me upside down
Spin me around
Spend all money on you all over this town

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that? (Would you look at that?)
I finally found somethin' I'm really good at
You thought it was over

Oh my mine
I'm such a lucky guy
You got me tongue tied
Like Jekyll &amp; Hyde
I'm coming undone
I'm born to run
I got my shades on
Here comes the sun
All cotton pickin'
My tick tocks tickin'
I love I'm stricken'
I'm flip flop flippin'
I'm 'bout to cuss
Son of a bus
I can't stop singin'
I'm havin' way too much fun

I can't change the world, no I can't change a flat
If you give me your heart, girl, well, you may never get it back
You said you'd never smile again, but oh no, here it comes
Would you look at that?
I finally found somethin' I'm so good at
Hahaha...
Cut!

There's a half a million sunsets I haven't got to show you
Don't ask me how I know, but I know they steal your breath
And I can almost feel the feeling that you're gonna give me
Especially when you kiss me like no one ever has
You're so real, I can't explain it, don't keep me waiting

You could be in Dallas or LA, 30,000 feet up on a plane
You could be the dream that I always chased
Every second, every place, always looking for your face
And I know it's one I'll never forget
So I guess I haven't met you yet

I saw two people talking in a corner booth cafe
Looking so in love thinking that could be us someday
I don't know what you're doing, I don't know where you are
But I swear, girl, when I meet you, you'll already have my heart

You could be in Dallas or LA, 30,000 feet up on a plane
You could be the dream that I always chased
Every second, every place, always looking for your face
And I know it's one I'll never forget
So I guess I haven't met you yet

Not yet, I still haven't got to hold yet
Not yet, I'm still tossing 'round on this bed
Not yet, I want you in my arms and out of my head

You could be in Dallas or LA, 30,000 feet up on a plane
Wherever you are, girl, I'm on my way
Every second, every place, always looking for your face
And I know it's one I'll never forget
So I guess I haven't met you yet

I guess I haven't met you yet
Oh, I haven't met you yet
I haven't met you, I haven't met you, I haven't met you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I got smoke in my hair
My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rockin' chair
Holdin' a beer in my hand
Sportin' a neon tan

My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club
Don't have a clue what went down
So I started callin' around

And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I found my billfold
I cried oh no, no
Good time Charlie got me
Now I'm broke
But it was worth actin' like a fool
Yeah, girl, I must really showed you

'Cause all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles when you walk in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seein' you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was Elvis rockin'
On the bar
Workin' the crowd
Pourin' out my heart


And all my friends say
I started shootin' doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him

You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some cain
I was a rock star, party hard
Gettin' over you comeback kid
Hey I musta did
What all my

That's what all my friends say

Luke Bryan - Baby's on the Way

I ain't been doin' to right
Since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast lost at work state of mind.
We're MEETING here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kinda sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff.
I'm feelin' out of place, but baby's on the way.

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she's got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Ain't gonna try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "When you fell from heaven, did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while.
Pull a few questions from my "Get to know Her Better" file.
Yeah, it's a real good day, cause baby's on the way.

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got, got me feelin' like this.
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Just a simple case of can't wait
Gonna be great to see her again.
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside
And in my eyes when she walks in.

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss.
Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Hey, hey. Baby's on the way.

Homecoming parade, you were the queen
I was riding right behind you with the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger as you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer could ever be so proud

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

On Wednesday nights, we'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids, and I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me, I thought God I'm a lucky man

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream was in the car in front of me

Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together through one more spring

Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat with tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant for wearing Sunday clothes

The car in front of me was carrying what I loved more than anything

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Time is tight and money's short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm
Pressure's on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh Mama, what am I gonna do
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything
Pray about everything

Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip
And your balloons go sailing off into the air
Oh Mama, what am I gonna do
She said,"Child, there's only one thing you can do"

Yeah take a walk, take a breath, oh give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole and catch a couple fish
And just like that toss'em back and make a little wish

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it stress about it, fret about it
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything

Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

There's a lot about life you can learn on a bus
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
Wide-eyed, baptized, and still wantin' to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks

That's us, haulin' hay in the field with the radio on.
That's us, headin' straight into town when the work was done
In my mind, I can still see us now, ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago

We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was huntin' and fishin' and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed, in our lives
Fallin' in and out of love, we rode in trucks

That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now, ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago, it's apart of my soul, yeah

Down where I was born, was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright

Luke Bryan - I'll Stay Me

T-shirt, blue jeans don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut ain't no redeye gravy on a biscut.
My deep Southern drawl makes the conversation crawl
You're gonna have to hang around long enough to hear me out.
Some folks aren't happy like they are.
Some wanna take things just a little too far.

Singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I am just what I am, I'm just what you see.
So I'll make it easy, I'll stay me.

My granny and pawpaw still missing Hee Haw
I love my little town where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street got a kiss just waitin on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries when I go over tonight.
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touchin' her love loving, hard working man.

Quarterbacks wanna play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes, but I still believe
I'm gonna make it easy, I'll stay me.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Ridin' down the road listenin' to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby this is it,
The one I wanted you to hear.
Don't it sound just like us?"

Up till then, all I'd ever listened to was
A little "Sweet Home...," "Tuesday's Gone,"
And "Working Man Blues."

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song

Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up,
Made me more aware of somethin' deep inside
Somethin' that I have,
A life I want to share
And I'll rememebr this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words,
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on,
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on...
My first love song

Baby... (Repeat chorus)

Yeah baby

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm

Hey I'm a country man a city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby I'm a country man

I've got a jeep with camouflage seats
That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little i-pod loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape player hater girl were cruising to Hank

Hey I'm a country man a city boy can't do the things I can
I can hot-wire your tractor and plow up your land
Hey baby I'm a country man

You like the ivy league hum-v tennis sweater type
But girl I'm here to tell you don't believe the high

Hey I'm a country I can wrestle hogs and gators with my two bare hands
Girl you better move quick I'm in high demand
Hey baby I'm a country man

Hey I'm a country man huntinh me a good ole'
Country girlfriend
Why don't you come and join me in my new deerstand
Hey baby I'm a country man
Hey baby I'ma country man

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There's a bonfire burning.
Got Bocephus blaring louder than allowed out in our neck of the neighborhood.
If you wanna see follow me over the river through the woods.

When the bugs and the beer start biting
There's bound to be some friendly fighting
Usually little Becky Lee winds up jumpin' up on somebodys hood
Don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gather round
Over the river through the woods.

Just follow my tail lights out past the streetlights a left then a hard right
They're goin' all night
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doin' what we should.
Over the river and through the woods

At first I thought she was kiddin when she mentioned skinny dipping.
She said follow me through the trees yes siree unless I misunderstood.
We'll splash and splish with the fish over the river and through the woods.

That's my beer can next to her beer can next to my work pants up there on dry land.
We'll do a little what we want after one long week of doin' what we should.
Over the river and through the woods.

That's my sore head layin in my truck bed eyes blood shot red hearing what my mamma said.
But we did a little what we want after one long week of doing what we should.
Over the river and through the woods.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You make me want to hold you like a hammock on a summer day 
Tell you how I'm gonna take your cares away
You make me want to
You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town 
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you 'til you feel the truth
You make me want to

You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to

Well I never met a girl like you
That's got me thinking like I do
To hang up my hat and kick off my boots
But you make me want to
You make me want to

You make me want to

Luke Bryan - Tackle Box

It was two shades of brown, scratched-up plastic.
It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches.
And his last name engraved in black,
Right there by the handle on the top.
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon.
Lug it down the bank with my arm draggin'.
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box.

'Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific.
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship.
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus.
And watch him run to Grandma, cryin' on the dock.
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.

He'd bait my hook and keep on tellin' stories
'Bout nickel Cokes, girls, and sandlot glories.
Pickup trucks and golden fields
Long before this town knew blacktop.

I was almost ridin' with him shotgun down those dirt roads
Takin' turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Fillin' the sky with dust and kicked up rocks
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.

He's been gone twenty years tomorrow
And I'm still holdin' on to one wish
That God above could let me borrow Grandpa
For one more afternoon and one more fish.

And I'd sail with him across the South Pacific.
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship.
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus.
And watch him run to Grandma, cryin' on the dock.
He'd open up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.

Everything he loved he kept locked up in that old tackle box.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I was sittin' there, sellin' turnips on a flat-bed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from.
She had HOLLYWOOD written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the Interstate.
Needin' directions and I was the man for the job.

I told her, "Way up yonder past the caution lights
There's a little country store with an old COKE sign.
You gotta stop and ask "Miss" Beth
For some of her sweet tea.
Then a left will take you to the Interstate,
But a right will bring you right back here to me."

I was sitting there, thinking 'bout her pretty face,
Kicking myself for not catchin' her name.
I threw my hat and said, "You fool, it could've been love."
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down.
She probably didn't like me anyhow.
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust.

Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me,
Or am I really seein' what I think I see.
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me-ee-eee.

She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but somethin' felt right.
When she stopped in and asked Miss Beth
For some of her sweet tea.
Momma gave her a big ole glass
And sent her right back here to me.

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin' "Son, it's way too dry"
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Ain't nothin' like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringin' out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When the tin roof gets to talkin' it's the best love we've made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they wanna cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, ha ha ha
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm walkin' down the stree, shufflin' my feet
Whistling a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along

I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by

I Like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow layin' low
Rolling anywhere that the wind wanna blow

I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Baby, what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions everyday
I can lean in to hold you, or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I

Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving
Baby those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now I'm second guessing everything I see

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I

Still give you what you need
Still take your breath away
Or light up the spark way down deep, baby do I

Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life

Tell me baby do I get one more try
Do I, baby do I

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There's a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
That's what country is

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on.
I pulled over 'cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, just singing our songs
Everybody round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain't leaving till I hear you say what's going on
It'll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I'm gone

Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Girl, don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

We've been up here in this city.
Livin' in the grease and grime.
Girl it's a doggone pity
We haven't been gettin' any time.
I've been preachin' bout back home.
It can make you feel so alive.
I'll tell ya what we can do,
Baby let's me and you take a little drive

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go up around the bend
Lay by the river, crawl up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah

There ain't no card in your pocket.
If your gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here.
That's just the way it's been for so long
How'd you like that coke in a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go up around the bend
Lay by the river, crawl up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah

That straw in your hair,
Not an ounce of makeup on ya
As the sun goes down,
Girl I ain't never seen you lookin' so good
As you do right now

Outro Chorus:
Dancin' on the step side
How bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
Dancing on the stepside,
How bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'm holding on your rope

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's Like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you
Every time I see you

You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you
Every time I see you

I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you
Every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard would
Love a good break
But they feel it too
Every time I see you
Why I gotta see you?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have

Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along

Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're gonna pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kinda funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the track
And when that sun goes down
And there ain't no goin' back

Keep chuggin' along

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It took me and four of my buddies
Half the night to pull out my truck
I stood there and proclaimed to everybody
It's the last time I'll mess with this mud
The boys they all grinned
And two nights from then

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
I did it again

I took my first sip of cold beer
And tried not to spit it back up
I set it back down on that tailgate
Told myself I'd had enough
Then like a real man
I took hold of that can, and

I guess I'm a slow learner, I ought to know better
Than to do what I do, but I ain't no quitter

The other night we got a little rowdy
I woke up with one eye swole shut
Yeah things got out of hand at that party
I said that's it, it's 'bout time I grow up
But that next weekend, I called all my friends and

I did it again just one more time
Even I swore that I'd lost my mind
But I turned right around and just like a fool
Did what any old country boy'd do
Yeah what any old country boy'd do
I did it again, I did it again

Out in the sticks and the squirrels and the ticks
Andy my 30-06, I'm runnin' out of Miller Light
Trucks in park, the dog won't bark
Couple hours till dark
Wishin' one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day
All I killed's a twelve pack

Sittin' here waitin' on a deer, drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aimin' at the empties, missin' hittin' pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep movin'
My baby's on the phone sayin' baby come home
Where you been and
What you've been doin'
We'll I've been, sittin' here, waitin' on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets

The only deer I've seen's been John Deere green
And that don't mean, that I got a raw deal
'Cause ain't no boss callin' me hoss
Tickin' me off on the edge of this cornfield
On my second box of Winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck but it's been a good day

Sittin' here, waitin' on a deer,

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hey girl
Go on now
You know you've got everybody looking

Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love

Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' till the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on

Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Somebody's sweet little farmer shy,
With a gatle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony tail and a pretty smile,
Rope me in from a country mile

So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' till the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on

Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it for the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Now dance like a dandelion
In the name of the hill underneath the pines, yeah
Move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you and get to lovin' you 'fore the night is through
Baby you know what to do

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' till the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on

Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimming down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it for the moon, shake it for me girl, aww

Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me girl,
Shake it for me girl, shake it for me

All we do right is make love
We both know now that ain't enough
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong

Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed

Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Baby, who we are just didn't work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt
Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong

Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed

Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

Ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain't no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let's do what we do best
I guess everybody's got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed

Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn't have to try
Let's lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye
Let's kiss tomorrow goodbye

The cotton wood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive and a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime

Well if you ain't a ten, you're a 9.9
Tippin' and spillin' that homemade wine on your tied-up, t-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild, throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God Al-mighty
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom

Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime

So, let's slip on out, where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take off on out in the water

Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mhmm mhmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans

Drip of honey on the money maker gotta bee
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find...
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you, and high on summertime
Girl, I'm a little drunk on you

We met down at the floatin' dock
She snuck out, scared she might get caught
We were nervous
But it was worth it

There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms, it finally made sense
In that moonlight
I saw her tanlines

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her lying there
With her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

The fog rolled in, she said I better go
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir
She could keep

So I stayed and watched the sun rise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was
I can still see us

Every time my feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her lying there
With her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing but we didn't care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
A t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Girl I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song

I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

Gonna cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know the rising sun
Ain't no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave

Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas and the night's still alive

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song

I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

You got your hands up
You're rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singing every song

I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

I don't want this night to end

No, I don't want this night to end

He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walkin' off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think.
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"

But you don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack

He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearin' Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma,
She said I couldn't stay.
And buddy if you're wonderin',
How could I throw it all away"

You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call.
If you think it's just a bottle,
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack

If you never felt the fire,
Running through your veins,
If you've never seen the devil,
Face to face

You don't know Jack,
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks,
Until you've lost it all.
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God,
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack
You don't know Jack

There's peanut dust and corn husks driftin' through the air tonight
The marchin' band's warmin' up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

There's a thermos and a water jug rollin' around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringin' us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
'Til it's all done until we're all done

It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again

And I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I just keep rolling 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going, but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I just keep rolling 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going, but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I just keep rolling 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

I couldn't tell you honey, I don't know
Where I'm going, but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say

Is fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave

Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Oh, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Fire away
Oh, fire away
Fire away

Used to spend my nights out in bar rooms
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottle
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey

Streetlights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold

Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold

Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute, parachute

If you think you're going down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing you have left to hold

Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute, parachute

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There's a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And it's empty so right now I don't feel a thing
And I'll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference between whiskey and you

Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ain't a problem, they'll always sell me more
But your forgiveness, well that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

I've got a problem but it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome and I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down and bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference between whiskey and you

One's the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you

Oh, that's the difference between whiskey and you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been

From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
You're love's been so true

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been

From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been

From the moment you wake me up
'Til you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

I was looking for change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener

All we wanted was to get there fast
So we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers

We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's trying to find a way
To say what needs sayin'

Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playing

You and I, we're gamblers holding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you, you're betting on me

One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Down on the freeway
The sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling
Tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

One of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said grace

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground

Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

Well, she said, she didn't love me
And kicked me out the door
Now I'm livin' in one room
And sleeping on the floor

Think I'm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned

I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time

The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries

Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So we could all get stoned

I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got shit to do
All I've got is time

The bottle's all I've had
To be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned

Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bulletproof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood-shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth having, I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me, they'd asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn't die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around, but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around, but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith in the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around, but if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I can't remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And I'm sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, it'll all feel the same way to me

Sometimes I'm drunk
Sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

And sometimes I'm drunk
And sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
And I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes I'm drunk
Sometimes I'm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
And I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Cut my teeth on Daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a red bar on my side

And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky downtown Alabam'
Whole lotta like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah, they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to the Rio Grande
Whole lotta like I am all the time all the time
I'm in an outlaw state of mind

And there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran
Just don't give a damn all the time
in an outlaw state of mind

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes
But sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I cry, cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else

Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you
'Cause ever since and every single night you been gone
Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I cry, cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Postman delivered
"Past due" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
This morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And opened the door on my knee

Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, "It don't matter
'Cause it's the holiday season."
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
'Cause your love makes my life complete

Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for living
And being forgiving
So just go on if you want to be free

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

Hold on my right hand
Sweat of the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask from you
Is to treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

First you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that's in your hand
Want you to understand
I would've given it to you anyway

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address

There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up, I've finally changed
And that someone I was is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around

You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up, I've finally changed
And that someone I was is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around

You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
I woke up some mornings with I don't know who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now

You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'd hate to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of giving damns
All my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't help, you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
It's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

You know I told you that I don't love you
That I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby, I was wrong

What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here, right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

Girl, you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby, I was wrong

Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes, it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine

Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime

Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime

Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in

I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

Yeah, that's the kinda shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always had a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems

There ain't no good light here below

Don't want no preacher man to come around

Already told Jesus everything I know

Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so

Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call

They say love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, and it can't be sold
I got love, love to spare
That made me a millionaire

I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She makes me, a millionaire

When we ride around, ride around this old town
In a beat up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say that boy is sure living in luxury, sweet luxury

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
And that made me a millionaire

When her kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

Hey girl, you know what you've been missing?

I'll be your smooth ride, that late night, your Walter White high
I'll be your first time, that's so right
Get you falling in love at the end of the night

Laying face first in an old box fan
Talking like Darth Vader

Beau Jackson, Oakland Raiders
Michael Jackson with a glove on my hand
Moonwalking like Billy Jean
No, I wasn't tryna change the world
All I ever really wanted to be was

Cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be cool, cool
Yeah, we all wanna be
Lost a little love, broke a few hearts
Lost a few nights shutting down bars
Lost a good fake ID or two
We never lost our cool
Lost friends and we lost touch
Got a little older, but we never grew up
There's a reason new school wants to be old school
We never lost our cool, cool

We never lost our cool, cool

Yeah, so cool

So dang cool

Good old boys and a hip-hop bass
808s and a hoopty hoopte

Can't sever them southern roots
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochie
Played a little football, first game
Had to get the girls with the sick shades
Playing every song 'til your fingers bleed
Doing everything just tryna be

Cool, cool

Cooler than the whip on the top of the pie
Cool and the gang's celebrating the night
Kool Aid mustache, 4th of July

Girl I guess you gotta sit on my lap - oh well
Climb through the barb wire

Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

Your true beauty's description
Look so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus 99
And it's a shame, don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control, baby you know

If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you
Yeah, Listen

If I was your man, baby you'd
Never worry about what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
A fistful of diamonds, a hand full of rings
Baby you're a star, I just want to show you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you how true love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Baby, you should let me love you

Five hundred horses outside at the valet
I got the keys, if you want, we can leave here tonight
24/7, your body's on my brain
But it don't mean ish if somebody else is on your mind

'Cause I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, and I'm touchin' on you
That you know, yeah you know, yeah you know what you're getting into
I don't care what he does 'cause he's only wasting his time
And I know what you like, what you like

Who's it gonna be?
Baby is it him or me?
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be?
Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
Cause you got me at hello now
Who's it gonna be?

(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
(Who)

It's paradise when I'm touching your body
Put my hands on your waist
We can keep making ways on if you want
You should be mine
Cause you just ain't anybody
Take it or leave it, but I'll never leave you alone

So who's it gonna be?
Baby is it him or me?
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be?
Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
Cause you got me at hello now
Who's it gonna be?

(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)

'Cause I know, yeah I know, yeah I know, and I'm touchin' on you
That you know, yeah you know, yeah you know what you're getting into
I don't care what he does 'cause he's only wasting his time
And I got what you like, what you like

So who's it gonna be?
Baby is it him or me?
We can fix this easily
If you just follow me home now
Who's it gonna be?
Cause you know he can't compete
I'm the only one you need
You should probably let him know now
Who's it gonna be?

(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)
(Who)
(Gonna be, gonna be)

It hurts so bad to watch you leave
We packed your stuff, and I set you free
Baby don't turn around
You don't want to see another tear fall down
Just keep heading towards anything that ain't me
We laid our hearts out on the table
Mine want you to stay, yours isn't it
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Every time I close my eyes, I see your face behind those headlights
Pulling back into that driveway
Hearing everything I wanna hear you say
Like, "I love you", "I need you", "I missed you"
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Yeah, back to me, back to these arms of mine
Patiently waiting for you
This door is always gonna be open for you
Back to me, back to us
Yeah, I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me, back to me
I hope you find just what you're looking for
I see in your eyes, you ain't got that fire no more
So go on and run, see what there is to see
But I hope when you're done, you'll run, you'll run straight back to me
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)
(Back to me, back to me, back to me)

Don't say a word, or I'll be gone
You broke me down for so long
I been going over the things I could have done
But you never loved me enough

Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I played your part, but it's time you said

Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

I stumbled home through the night
And as you slipped into my mind, mmm
We tried for so long, but you set the stage for the fall
My heart needs to learn that you're gone

Cause all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
I'm putting these ghosts to rest, so don't say

Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

And all I know is that letting you pull my strings is getting old, so old
And I don't wanna hear you say that

Maybe if you get your act together
Maybe if you love me just a little bit better
Well maybe there was nothing I could do at all
You said, maybe if we spent some time apart
Picking up the pieces of a broken heart
But maybe there was nothing I could do at all, all

Ball cap to a flip flop
A toe ring to the tip top
From Haggard to the hip hop
She can play either side of a bad cop, good cop

From a sun dress to her Sunday best
A cover girl type or just a hot mess
Oh my my yeah
She's the girl that got my heart beatin' out of my chest

She's a blue jean roll sweet supermodel
Like a stained glass rain from a broken bottle
Make ya promise she won't
But she know she gonna
Yeah she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a roman candle she's a tin revival
She's a needle dancin' on classic vinyl
She a sunset wish with a ten mill smile
Her own kind of beautiful
Beautiful

A hello yeah just clicked
So she settled in for a slow sip
And when we leave in a little bit
All the other guys will be so pissed

She's an blue jean roll sweet supermodel
Like a stained glass rain from a broken bottle
Make ya promise she won't
But she know she gonna
Yeah she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a roman candle she's a tin revival
She's a needle dancin' on classic vinyl
She a sunset wish with a ten mill smile
Her own kind of beautiful
Beautiful
You're beautiful

From her sundress to her Sunday best
That Maybelline red lip gloss kiss
Oh my, my yeah
She's the girl that got my heart beatin' out of my chest

She's an blue jean roll sweet supermodel
Like a stained glass rain from a broken bottle
Make ya promise she won't
But she know she gonna
Yeah she's her own kind of beautiful
She's a roman candle she's a tin revival
She's a needle dancin' on classic vinyl
She a sunset wish with a ten mill smile
Her own kind of beautiful

You're beautiful

Yeah her own kind of beautiful

She's a roman candle she's a tin revival
She's a needle dancin' on classic vinyl
She a sunset wish with a ten mill smile
She's her own kind of beautiful

She only wants me on the weekend
Why do I want it all the time?
I even see you when I'm sleeping
The only thing that's on my mind

I've been spending my money and spending on mind
I been cool with your friends; I remembered your sign
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it...

Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time

When you're shaking that, shake it all over baby
You got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it

I give my love and she just takes it
No, she don't even need to ask
Don't give it back, she don't replace it
Looking at that, I can't be mad

I've been spending my money and spending on mind
I been cool with your friends; I remembered your sign
But she only wants me on the weekend
And why do I want it...

Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
You know I want it all the, you know I want it all the time

Shaking that, shake it all over baby
Got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
Don't know what I love, but you're gonna make it
You know I want it all the time

Ooh, oh oh
She only wants me on the weekend
I give what she wants all the time
She always leave me when I'm sleeping
Why do I want it...

Why do I want it all the time?
Why do I want it all the time?
If I said I didn't, I'd be lying
She knows I want it all the, she knows I want it all the time

(She knows, she knows, she knows)
Shaking that, shake it all over baby
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
Got a mean, bad body, got to celebrate it
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
Don't know what I love, but you're gonna make it
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
You know I want it all the time

Standing here, drink it in
Everything you been pouring
Like the way it goes down
And I like the taste on your tongue
I'm gonna let you hold me
Even if it's just for now

I know where it's gonna go
You're so predictable

You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose to come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
Swear I'll never leave you

Lying here, next to you
I've never felt so perfect
Even if it's just for now
With paper hearts and kerosene
One word can spark a fire
You build it up and burn it down

Love has its rituals
We're so predictable

You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose to come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you

Love has its rituals
We're so predictable

You always love me in circles
You hurt me on purpose to come around again, come around again
You're so determined to break me
To say that you saved me
You come around again, come around again

I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you
I'm so mad about you
I can't live without you
I love you, I need you
I swear I'll never leave you

Quick stop as the quick sign
Six in on a twelve pine
Way too many people in the back
Girl I guess you gotta sit on my lap - oh well
Climb through the barb wire
Light something on fire
Just watch it get higher
Yeah gonna be another all nighter

Yeah we're just living living
Doing a little sipping sipping
See who's kissing on who
Yeah take off running when the lights turn blue

Might call it crazy
Call it drunk and dumb and dangerous
They can call the cops on us
Call it never growing up
Call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
It ain't nothing but another Saturday night

Find a place where we all park
Drop a tailgate and make a bar
Drop the jolly rancher in a jar
To there's a halo round the stars uh huh
All the girls wanna skinny dip
Shimmy them shorts off of their hips
Somebody gotta busty lip
Trying to do a Rose-Swing cannonball flip
Yeah we're getting rowdy rowdy
When you're head gets cloudy cloudy
Hey baby how bout we see
Just how loud we can be

Might call it crazy
Call it drunk and dumb and dangerous
They can call the cops on us
Call it never growing up
Call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
It ain't nothing but another Saturday night

In just another day
And in the summertime it's every other day
Hey baby do I make you wanna say
Hoohoo-
When you're restless and you're thirsty
You can act like it's you're birthday
Yeah we do it right Yeah we do it right
Out here don't you know about our Saturday night

It gets crazy
It gets drunk and dumb and dangerous
Let 'em can call the cops on us
They can call it never growing up
They can call it what you like
But out here, way out here
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
It ain't nothing but another Saturday night
Yeah we just call it Saturday night
It ain't nothing but another Saturday night
