One, two, three
Uh and here we go

Sending this message into space with my ray gun
Hoping that important ears will hear this when the days done
So far it's been great fun
You would swear I've been playing with myself
'Cause I been doing me since day one
They used to swear that I would never have a smash hit
Now I see them haters double-take no ad-libs
'Cause what comes from his lips is crack, Chapstick
What I'm composing, I'm singing, mixing, and writing bars
So I guess I make it easy to pick out my flaws
'Cause when one things crazy another's sub-par
So I guess I gotta make it work tr-tr-triple times as hard
The engineers will have my head is the mix is off
Rappers will be coming at my neck if the 16 is wrong
Singers keep telling me that I got a couple vocals flaws
But every single one of them is like "Yo! Your talents raw"

I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh

A... yeah first time listening to me
If you just popped a mixtape in or something
This is what I do, I make feel good music
I guess don't expect anything more or less
I just make whatever I feel like making

So please don't try and save me
This is how my story ends
This keeps me from going crazy
So I'll be writing till my death
I'm on my 3AM flow and I'm chilling with these lights low
This tracks too sexy I might just call a friend and see where the night goes

I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
I think I'm heading in the right direction
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh

But yeah, like I said
The label is Beautiful Mind
My name is Jon Bellion and the mixtape is Scattered Thoughts Volume 1
Welcome, hope you like it. Word!
Yo, this beat is tough
I mean I made it but this beat is tough
I can say that

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

So basically you're like the only person
Who's not impressed by any of this and I love that

Work-a-holic, I'm a bad one
Sitting in front of this computer
Couldn't move me with a handgun
Us musicians are a sad bunch
Half the time I can't remember if I had lunch

(But she knows my heart she knows my heart)
She knows my heart (my heart)
She knows my heart (my heart...)
She knows, knows my, knows my

I understood when you were mad at me
When I was late to the Cheesecake Factory
I came an hour late but you fled the scene
Spanish waiter said "she peace'd around 9:15

Before anybody's trunk knocked
I was a skinny little Italian
With nothing but a jump shot
And if I ever got a hot head
She would call up Judy Bellion
In a hot sec, you bet

She's like a song so eclectic
And her eyes are like a string section
And her legs are like a electric guitar
And I'm Hendrix
I'm tempted to shred along her frets kid

You get it?
Like shred along her frets
Like a guitar reference 'cause her legs...
Like I'm basically explaining this right now
She's not even gonna be able to follow what's going on
And I think, like I said before
That's what I like most about her
What's wrong with me?

She sees past everything
No smoke, no mirrors
To see me clearer
I think about wedding rings
Let me slow down (oh no)
Let me slow down (oh no)
And if she ever left this home
I'd have trouble breathing on my own
Now I feel like you need to know
You gave wings, gave wings to my soul

Thank you Dilla for your swing and pocket
And ridiculous you did, that inspired me
And The Roots, you guys go without say

But she knows my heart...
My heart...
My heart...

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

She's a lady when she shakes hands in the streets
But she's an animal once we're up in the sheets
And I never win in Mario Kart 'cause she always cheats
Oh but that is okay because she's D.O.P.E
I have two parking tickets, she has forty-three
And all my friends they love her, she drinks more than me
And she really doesn't give a damn if I sing out of key
So baby what it look like, you're so D.O.P.E
Uh and she's the definition of my everything
I want to tell her so many things
Kick back, now I'm thinking about a wedding ring

She so dope, she so crazy
She's all mine so don't try to play me
'Cause your hands have a hold on me
'Cause you're so D.O.P.E. (D.O.P.E., D.O.P.E)

I-I-I was trying to stick so close to the plan
Couldn't find my heart than it rose from the sand
So I propose a toast East Coast to Japan
Give you a massage for your soul in my hands
So much in common
She is mos def the stars to my comet
She so new age and far from the logic
That I can't find love and have it for eternity
Pick it up now
She could rock the hippy look she so outta sight
I'm just glad I made the cut, I'm so samurai
Everything is cool with her, she don't need no candlelight
Dinner, she's a winner, we can kick it, chill at T.G.I
Fridays have a 2-for-1 but usually turns into 5
Who the hell is driving home, guess we got a taxi ride
Knock me out with a kiss like a jab
'Cause it punch-drunk love in the back of the cab
And I can't feel my face
But you look so damn great

She so dope, she so crazy
She's all mine so don't try to play me
'Cause your hands have a hold on me
'Cause you're so D.O.P.E. (D.O.P.E., D.O.P.E)

D.O.P.E, D.O.P.E
And I can't feel my face
But you look so damn great
D.O.P.E, D.O.P.E
And I can't feel my face
But you look so damn great

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Baby let me know how it goes
When you go back to Heaven for the day
And baby let me know how it goes
When you're loving him, but you should be loving me
And baby let me know how it goes
When you realize you and him were never meant to be
And baby let me know how it goes
When you realize, oh when you realize
You should've been loving me

Beautiful Mind, Mind (Beautiful Mind, Mind)
Mind, Mind, yeah
(Trying to find my) Trying to find my soul
Trying to find my (Yo I hate being) soul
(Haha, I'm sorry)
Samira Gibson, trying to find my (Trying to find my) soul
(Trying to find my)

Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back
Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back

I said "I'm just trying to get my soul back" yeah
Said "I'm just trying to get my soul back"
Some where along this road, may have lost my way
But baby I'm ready to step again
Said "I'm just trying to get my soul back" yeah
Said "I'm just trying to get my soul back"
I look right and I might just give you
Something to talk about, baby you better tell a friend

I'm just trying to get my soul back
I'm just trying to get my soul back
See it don't matter what you say to me
You're making music for my soul
For my soul, for my soul

Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back

My soul is a slick opportunist used in lyrics
Here's a meal for your thoughts, food filled with spirit
Never been affected by dudes who couldn't feel it
When I'm buried in the seam, I choose to Kill Bill it
I make music for my own uses
Never worry about approval from so called cool kids
Used to reduce thoughts of who I influenced
Now I'm all about a target, hitting hearts like Cupid
I from the land of break-beats and skate decks
Baselines and backpacks, good tape and tape decks
Making music from the heart
Trying to separate the real from the fake
But was standing in the dark
They used to tell me where the honey's at
During their recording and I bought it
Now I'm trying to get my money back
I can't say when me and soul departed
But I'm just trying to get back to where it started

Ah...
Get that soul back, I'm a get that soul back
T-t-trying to get that soul back

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You know uh the world is a dangerous place baby and
And I think you just kick and stay in for the day
Yeah, you can stay with me. I mean, you know
Whatever happens, happens
You know it's dangerous out there, ya know?
Let me talk to you

With so much wrong in the world
I'm just glad I found you
I'm just glad I found you
So many guns shot for no reason
I'm just glad I found you
I'm just glad I found you
Oh

So lovely if we go outside
I think we'd be risking our lives

So I have an idea
We should make love, we should make love
Till the world comes back around
Till the world comes back around
We should make love, love, love, love, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Till the world comes back around

Come on baby. You know, you know it sounds good
So let me, let me explain it to you

I'm just trying to lay low, she'll see where the day goes
Stay home, I will give you loving by the case loads
Stay up in the shade, you'll get burned by the sun's rays
Don't go for a run cutie, I can make your pulse raise
Risky situations for the birds, they can have 'em
'Cause the only one I'm inviting, my friend Sam Adams
And eleven of his friends, make a twelve pack slap'em
On the couch, we can sip'em till it's safe outside
Instead of watching the economy slide
I'm just trying to see my fingertips glide
Across your body, that's the safest flight I'm gonna fly
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
'Cause I'm a sure shot
Leave it if the door knocks
'Cause these sheets and these pillows and blankets be like Fort Knox
We can jam on the bed to we switch and let the floor rock

So lovely if we go outside
I think we'd be risking our lives

So lovely if we go outside
I think we'd be risking our lives

So I have an idea
We should make love, we should make love
Till the world comes back around
Till the world comes back around
We should make love, love, love, love, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Till the world comes back around

See I'll even do a piano solo for you
Yeah! Woo!
Ewa-ewa-e, ass stay home, ewa, off day
So is that a yes or a no? Hehehehe

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Dope little boy, uh
Dope little boy
1, 2, 3

Stay steady rockin'
Feel good flow with a half-pipe Jones
Baby watch me drop in
I think the key is to never feel locked in
Just as long as you comfy in the pocket
Kids explore options
Don't listen to the outside world, it's obnoxious
They will try to cut your balls with no topspin (get it?)
Mentally and physically, you need to stay clocked in

Dope little boy, boy
Don't believe any of their lies
Dope little boy, boy
They can barely sleep with themselves at night
Dope little boy, boy
Never ever will they break your flow
Dope little boy, boy
Just keep doing things from your soul

(Yeah, yeah. This feels crazy)
I ain't on the guest list, 'cause I ain't a big deal
Mouth so Fresh Prince 'cause I gotta a stronger will
Smith and Wesson, keep bangin' on them, let 'em feel
Everything you do and spread love till the grinned' real
Why, Look a live little boy? 'Cause you're up next
Now that I'm making it, these girls are sending dumb text
I won't change if ten-thousand and change
Scream my name at a show like I had a lot of rough sex
Please excuse the nerdiness, I'm flirting with a lot of styles
Exploring lanes so insane, at a hundred miles
I'm just a kid, scruffy hair, with a goofy smile
But I had developed tough skin, no crocodiles
In the process of dream chasing
I will make what I feel like making
Hip Hop to Pop is two languages
But I'm somewhere in the middle, so Spanglish
And if you're not putting out a good vibe
Stay the hell home 'cause we're trying to have good time
They say he's gotta climb, but he's been fine
'Cause he feels good music in the air, wind chimes
Just know that my patience wearing thin
'Cause from cockiness to retardation is thin line
Just know that I'm in it for the win
'Cause I'm pushing real hard like I been ventured incline
Dilla and The Roots are stupid for this bassline
Two thumbs up. Woo! Great time
(Yo!)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Okay so I wrote this song drunk
And I'm recording this song drunk
So this is for her

I'm staring at old picture frames
I think I kinda miss your face
Maybe we could spend the day
Remember how we used to lay down
And you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
And you know that this beer won't drink itself
Hehehe, oh, oh

Haven't seen you since last December
You're even prettier than I remember
Oh, you're like a breath of fresh air I would take in
Is it weird I wish you were naked
Oh, you love my jokes
I said "oh, you always loved my jokes"
I said "oh"
So if I went to kiss you
Would you kiss me back
Said "oh,"
I know it's been a while but I hope so

I'm staring at old picture frames
I think I kinda miss your face
Maybe we could spend the day
Remember how we used to lay down
And you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
And you know that this beer won't drink itself
Hehehe, oh, oh

Unh, since when did you grow up, Hello Kitty always
Was on your bags and your socks, and cooties was always
My fear, now you're all Sex and The City on me
So grown, so mature, and so able bodied
To pay yo taxes, take it back to class
When I didn't have no Chapstick, I was so average
You were so bright-eyed and still believed in magic
We were so natural, but now we're so plastic
When did we grow up
Let's smash the clock and slow up
But if I have to hear one more thing about your business career
I might just throw up
But you showed up
Which so proved the old you's in there somewhere
So moved, the old school, into an only past
But let's open a new book as we go pass

I'm staring at old picture frames
I think I kinda miss your face
Maybe we could spend the day
Remember how we used to lay down
And you know you don't have as much fun with anyone else
And you know that this beer won't drink itself
Hehehe, oh, oh

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

(Rock it, rock it!)
Da, da, da, da-da-da, da, da, da
Da, da, dada-dum-da, da

Oh, I took all your records
Then smashed them on the floor
Then I came up with this melody
Till this baseline shook my floor
And after all the pain you've cause me
I see one things true, true...
Oh this song
Sounds like me getting over you

Now if you with me, stand up and just rock it
Her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
This is a public service announcement for those who've fallen
And goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit

Oh, I took all your records
Then smashed them on the floor
Then I came up with this melody
Till this baseline shook my floor
And after all the pain you've cause me
I see one things true, true...
Oh this song
Sounds like me getting over you

(Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful Mind)
Go head an tantrum, throw your fits (da, da, da, da)
I've built my bridge up over this (da, da, da, da)
Like Jersey Shore, I'm sure I've missed
'Cause I'm turning heart-breaking to hits
Hit the reset button on the play back
I'm just amazed that, you can erase that
ASAP out of your mind, it's like Ajax
'Cause you wipe me clean baby, eight stacks
Couldn't pay for this lesson learned
When I hit the dance floor baby, heads will turn
'Cause I'm looking good, turn to my bottle and kissed it
'Cause a drink looks a lot better than your lipstick

Now if you with me, stand up and just rock it
Her imprint on my mind been replace with this drum pocket
This is a public service announcement for those who've fallen
And goes for anybody who gave it all with no profit

Everybody's mad, extra, all the time
I think we need more tracks like this
This is "Something2Relax2"

Something to relax to

Indian style on top of a waterfall flow
Had my whole life in front of me, watched it all go
Smoothly on top of the charts
Was me all up in my drop
But then my dream level popped
It seems life is always different when we open our eyes
This song goes out to anybody trying to get by
But it's constantly low, so you gotta stay high
If this could help you with your issues, then I need you to vibe
I don't really care for the tough guy image
I'm pretty sure a mother, who is spent but has given
Everything to her children, three jobs just for living
Doesn't really give a - if I get mad women
Skaters to the gangsters, punks to the preps
Everybody's got issues and for that I'll rep
Don't usually spit but this is something I'll rap to
Ego at the door and this is something to relax to

Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)

Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to
Something, something to, (relax, relax)

Something to relax to
Something, something to relax to
Something to relax to

Said "Oh, it's the night before the mixtape drops"
And I'm just trying to rest my head
It's the night before the mixtape drops
And a bunch of dark thoughts fall in my head

What if it's not everything I want it to be
What if it sounds real good to me
But it doesn't sound good to him or her or anyone, oh, oh
Then it hits me that I really don't mind
But I'd be lying if I said that "I didn't think twice"
And I'ma say something I know I'll regret
But here it goes
We all just want to be loved

See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be, see I just want to be loved

And everything I do, I swear I'm self-conscious
Ridiculous, this is nonsense
And just admitting this, I'm getting kind nauseous
But I am not afraid, I am not afraid...
I am not afraid to admit I just want to be loved

See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be, see I just want to be loved

I write how I feel and I will spit accordingly
Half of y'all are boring me
My tanks filled with thoughts that I ought to get rid of
So I'll pass B, please don't gas me
And I'm just trying to see progress
But y'all don't want to see change
'Cause y'all be non-sense, get it?
Well maybe you do or maybe you don't like the song
So from the start I've been a fool

See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See we just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be loved, is that so much to ask?
See I just want to be, see I just want to be loved

22, and confused
On what to do and how to set it up
Kinda drunk, sort of high
She's a broken miss America
Never learned how to love 'cause the answers are stuck
Behind closed doors
You can call it a night when the lights in the club don't shine no more
When the lights in the club don't shine no more
When the lights in the club don't shine no more

Only Kanye knows how to make it in America
Never learned how to love 'cause the answers are stuck in
All of the lights all of the lights
You can call it a night when the lights in the studio shine no more
When the lights in the studio shine no more
When the lights in the studio shine no more

Beautiful, Mind, Mind, Mind
She's literally like 5 feet away from me
While I'm recording this, sleeping on the couch
This is for her, sleepy ass

I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep
You're behind me on the couch and in the studio
So I'm gonna make this all about sleep
And soft so I don't wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you dig it
Only I can make some soft shit and rip it
I knew you were dope from the jump like ribbit
'Cause all these other girls fall short like midgets

The Sandman gonna flip when he come through
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to

I wrote this while I'm watching you sleep
Your hair is all over the place and I love it
I won't put the bass in this beat
If it knocks I might wake you up
You're smiling as you sleep so you like it
She just let me work 'cause she know I cook diamonds
She know I'm paid but she still 9-5ing
That's why she allowed to hang while I'm writing
Hahaha

The Sandman gonna flip when he come through
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to
While you count sheep I'll give him music to jump to

Dopest musical breakdown ever, ready?
If I make this
And maybe you will wake up and naked
Girl I'm playing, girl I'm playing, girl I'm playing
Maybe not

See it went from talking shit loud
To graduating to whispers
Still chilling painting pictures with the hipsters
And since I produced the record
Please hold while I insert
A bassline dirtier than kissing on your sister (ew)
Still clearing 30 racks, cigarettes, and leather jackets
Pimp coats, and feathered hats
Lose the phone, never that
My mother's cooking sauce
I'm more Italian than Sinatra's kids
Fashion is a chore to me
I'm partying in moccasins
Rocking with the scholars
Then taking shots up with the college kids
Please don't try and copy me
You're cheating while I'm proctoring
Positively optimistic
Hopping on the opposite
Of every single thing they ever told me to do
So put the hate down and watch me spaz out
To sounds John Lennon would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spaz out
To sounds John Lennon would be proud-

Oh as I take off on an airplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yeah I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly

Let me hear the dreamers yell
Oh oh oh oh la da da da da da

Yeah, for a proper introduction
This is keys without the locksmith
A new year, I'm tired of rapping on that nonchalant tip
You scholars think you can roast my associate with hot shit
You're hopeless, 'cause this bachelor is a master when a doc spits
Work all day and laid back collecting bills at night
We're fly enough to make the sell see us, still we're fearing heights
Waiting to blow, getting impatient, I've been chasing
Mister Myers with a knife
Flipping the script because I'm killing mic's
My entourage is a bunch of guys
Who walk around mauling all the moms in every mall
With that sharpened claws
Not talking Santa or a certain type of grammar
I'm a standout
Not handing handouts to all your open paws
So put the hate down watch me spaz out
To sounds Kurtis Blow would be proud of
Put the hate down and watch me spaz out
Yo sounds Kurtis Blow would be proud-

Oh as I take off on an airplane
I realize the dream that I'm chasing is true
Yeah I'm afraid of heights
But I'm not afraid to fly

Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)
Never wake up from your dreams (your dreams)

You know, maybe I'm drunk
Maybe I'm not
Maybe this happened, maybe this didn't

Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That's I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets

My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"

Beautiful family friend is she
Almost a decade older than me
And I've been gone for quite a while overseas, yeah...
And she's been living up in Albany
Then I had two shows I played up state
She came to show love and see my face
Then we got drinks and we chilled like "hey"

Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That's I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets

My homies like "dead man, dead man walking"
My homies like "you a dead man, dead man walking"

Now she's like "Damn!
How did we let this happen, damn!
How did we end up in this bed then?"
I said "relax" and laughed like
"This would be a pretty dope song."
She's like "no, I swear to God I'll kill you
No, I really will just take your life
No, don't even think about it
But that would be a pretty dope song."
So I came home and I called my friends
Then we got smacked and I wrote this jam
I know for a fact that I'm going
It's over, My life is dead ass over

Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
'Cause a dead man walks the streets
'Cause my sister has a best friend
That's I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled
'Cause we tangled in the sheets

The funny thing about this entire thing
You know like doing the one-take, write it quick, fun jokes?
But my sister won't hear this until I release the album
She'll hear every other song except this one
So surprise

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's so empty right where your head sleeps
And she said I still smell your cologne in my bed sheets

So I said I'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
And she said some days I'm okay but when I'm alone it hurts because

Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

When did love letters get lost in translation? (translation, translation)
I heard you took the train from Penn station (Penn station, Penn station)

So I said I'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
And she said some days I'm okay but when I'm alone it hurts because

Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

I have to tape my mouth
I want to ask you questions
Like do you sleep alone
I heard there's friends you rest with
So I text her friend
Like tell me where this man's at
She says you got some balls
You don't deserve to ask that

Oh no they gotta be lying
I'm dying to know
But I know you're not mine
So I can't say shit

So I said I'm just texting you to see how you're holding on
And she said some days I'm okay but when I'm alone it hurts because

Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves
Loneliness comes in waves, waves, waves

All that ass it was so first class
She was my co-pilot with a mile high swag
We would smoke all night just flyin' high like that.
Smoke smoke all night just flyin' high like, high like
I needed her, I know she needed me
If we fly this thing it's gonna take two people
But the storm came fast
Got a little rocky, the oxygen mask from the ceiling they were dropping

We started to fall right out the sky
Without a warning call. Nah-hoo...
We started to fall, no parachute so we had no time to call, for mayday mayday...
We bought two tickets and and a paradise,
One last flight trying make it right
But that's when the rain came,
That's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it far.
We bought two tickets and a paradise
One last flight tryna make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane.
I know we tried to fly away, but we were just a
Paper plane.

It's funny how things end up
It's funny how we break it off
Relationships they nose dive,
While ones career is taking off.
Publishing checks and fake smiles as I see my dad,
My pockets getting filled
But really emptiness is all I have.
We crash, and now there's spare parts.
Bandages, and bad scars.
We try to mend broke Amelia Earharts.
And keep trying to fly on, fly on, fly on.
But I'm missing my right wing
My right arm, and that's you.

We started to fall right out the sky
Without a warning call. Nah-hoo...
We started to fall, no parachute so we had no time to call, for mayday mayday...
We bought two tickets and and a paradise,
One last flight trying make it right
But that's when the rain came,
That's when the pain came
Were never ever gonna make it far.
We bought two tickets and a paradise
One last flight trying make it right
But love came like a hurricane and we were just a paper plane.
I know we tried to fly away, but we were just a
Paper plane.

Fell in sleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice woman, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked "when will it be my time?"
They said "boy don't even look at the clock."
'Cause you're gonna be timeless

I'm not afraid to be a leader (gonna be)
To be remembered by the readers (gonna be)
My generation's Mona Lisa (gonna be)
Whoa-ooh-whoa yeah (no, no, you're gonna be)
I'm not afraid to be a hero (gonna be)
To be known wherever we go (gonna be)
I was told I was a zero (gonna be)
But no, no, no, no, no (You know you're gonna be)
And I can't sit and wait for all my plans
God didn't make this man
To be stuck in the middle of nowhere land
So watch me, set this moment on fire (you know you're gonna be)

Fell in sleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice woman, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked "when will it be my time?"
They said "boy don't even look at the clock."
'Cause you're gonna be timeless

This that feeling that you get from all these knock outs
My sister said "don't release it if you're not down"
So don't worry about the records that I swap out
I'm reaching for that Goosebump shit from College Dropout
Never let opinions split me in two
I keep smiling and do what I do
How he so quiet but that dope shine through
Because it's humbling when you're message is bigger than you
Yah! I grew up in a internet age
With 10, 000 freaking records on my internet page
It's kinda thought to not blend all the records I played
I'm just the one that's not afraid to make sickening lane
Yah! Shouts to CuDi just doing what feels right
Shouts to kids who don't know what they really like
'Cause we're the same, we're just making music every night
And we're the reason why these A&amp;R's are getting fired

Fell in sleep I had a kick-ass dream
Me, Frank Sinatra, James Dean
Sammy Davis at the bar drinking Moonshine
Nice woman, white wine, chillin' poolside
So I asked "when will it be my time?"
They said "boy don't even look at the clock."
'Cause you're gonna be timeless

(Oh yeah)
Anxiety dances... across my pillow case, my God it dances
It's like, 1, 2 step
It's asking stupid questions
Like "are you living right?" Such stupid questions
Because I'm just trying to
I'm trying live, I'm trying rise, above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-Insert something really dope right here
I'm supposed to write a hook but all I wanna say is
I just want to be happy... (I just want to be happy)... want to be happy (eh yeah)

Money and riches blah blah yeah yeah
I just want to be happy... (I just want to be happy)... want to be happy (eh yeah)

I've been working my ass off
That's why Christina left me, been working my ass off
On this project, but I guess that it's okay
My family never liked you, I guess that it's okay
Now I'm just I'm just
I'm trying live I'm trying rise
Above the shit the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky

Listen boo boo, bear with me (yeah)
Smarter than your average
Raised around Brooklyn based Italian
There's so much soul up in my Johnson, I don't need a rapper on it
Because the urbans in my testes but I come and pop packaging (yikes)
Bunch of pricks talk shit, we call that cactusing
We don't want no fight club don't want no Brad Pitt'in
Braymance like this shit just when I'm ad-libbin'
Fronting on my Sean Penn what movie are you actin' in?
Seventh grade I said "I'm bout to leave the masses then"
My ex-girlfriend's sister said "you babbling"
Even back then cook crack, drug trafficking

I'm trying live, I'm trying rise, above the shit, the devil tries
Which is why I keep my eyes to the sky
(You're gonna be okay kid, you're gonna be, okay)

Grow old, with me

We'll have 2 seats, on my front porch
I'll still call you young girl
So young girl, rock with me

My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under forty and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard so

I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair exactly is what I like the best
And my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
But I don't know no hoodlum and you don't pass the test

I'm going to take you out, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

Oh, baby, I'm standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know, I'm over and done now
I am done now

My momma say that it was wrong to see you
I lie just to meet you, I lie to get in
And my momma she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she'd ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too

I'll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song

Yeah, it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, if it's less like I am dreaming

Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have, a feeling real bad
I'm final if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to cry, to thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?

Little bits and pieces, falling to the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Smiles from the stranger, seem to change a day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is our feeling, all my hurt is over

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us
When you left that place
You didn't want to go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you till you left
So you went away

Where did you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about
So many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust
On the floor again
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in a quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician
With the song
You like to write about all of your problems
The damning songs because you think it was often
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is
Why must I come to this?
You talk about
Being strong, yeah
How I want to be
You and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
You keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what what they say
You were not approved
But you are on the moon
I care about
How this turns out
It's just more than I
Heaven know how to fight
I guess I want
Tell me I have to
Tell me I have to
I know you couldn't
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight
Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night time

Cliches find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight
A dark room in the night time
Is how he spends all his time

If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot lack of lustre

He'll try tonight

You have a right
To live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might
If you have visions
Come on and live them out

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Till you are home, dear

I had a dream
When I was young
I dreamt our lives were
Going to be fun
When we were always
Waiting to live

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
I'll be it all, dear

You have the choice
To hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Don't say no, dear

Wake up each night
At the same time
Pull up the blind
And look outside
And in the orange light
The fog is rising

This is life
The still night
Peace in the quiet
Happiness
Is the sky

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

What an unusual name you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh, what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive sign on his arm, oh, my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he knows she'll never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said, how did I know you so well?
Why am I not surprised?
He said, baby, go to hell
And that was the demise, of their love

Don't ever pick up the man
If you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you
Have a history of being a loving fool

So, that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need

I do not know him so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh, tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
My love

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I touch you

I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don't think that you're going to want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don't want to keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don't

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Aren't you going to miss me?
Honey, I'll miss you
I just want to kiss you
Tonight

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm the fan of flying
Want to do it for the nation

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I'll see the way you'll be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, no, you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing, getting fire to them
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do
Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
Oh, no, you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down

Oh, no, you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me

You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

I don't quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

It's fine if you're hateful
As long as all in all you remain grateful

It made me nervous to know you didn't like me, I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Met you in front of the diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Oh, feather, oh, birds

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's 'cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
'Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better

It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?

Me home, me home
Me home again

We all know it, and I know it
Going to be a star

Back in the countryside

Oh, my soul
Rise up and go
Beyond, beyond

You have to take me right now,
From this dark trailer park life now,

Come on, kitty cat, fill her up
What's your name, little buttercup?
That's for me to know and you to make up

Love casinos and neon reservations
But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station

Look at you smoking in them neon lights
Under the thunder, yo, you like so nice
Made me wonder how you spend them nights
Me, I spend them looking for men you might like
Like you

Take me to the gas station

Give me coffee, Utah love
I'm the kind of girl you dream of
I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
With slurpee machines and organs playing

Preferably with smoking inside
If you can swing it
Can I be real pleased if we could find one just like here
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again

Love casinos and neon reservations
But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station

Oh, say can you see my stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys and look at the bars
Night time is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"
And I will
The night time is almost ours

A sway of the hips and arms
We'll cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired and send you to Mars
Night time is almost ours

So, I think we're going get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?

Pretty baby

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows

You want here, no?

Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day
Of the summer

Buy my purple wig
For my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live

On Neptune Avenue.

You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me Lavender, you call me Sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

We'll see Van Halen at their re-union show.

Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right, but letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's going to take money to go
Oh, no

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no

I can't do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're all right, but letting nice things go

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You know, a lot of people ask me
Why I feel, that, you know
I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And, umm, I don't know
People seem to be under the impression
That, I made it to this point, FAST
And, y'know obviously for me
I don't feel like that 'cause it's me y'know
I feel like I've been doing it, for ten billion years
But, every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for, y'know, getting me this far
Cause sometimes you don't realize how far you've gotten
Until you look around and, and you look at the people who
Who, who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that, that no matter what, it's
In the end it's not gonna be about my talent, y'know
It's not gonna be about my connections
It's not gonna be about my looks
It's, it's gonna be about, who wants it, the most
Annnnd, I want it the most!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I just came out of the muthafuckin' old school
Got my mac notebook with the pro tools
Y'all bitches ain't ready for Nicki Lewinsky
Bad woof woof flyer then a frisby
So I'm up in (?) eating mangoes
Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star they say wen I star spangle
But for buh; buh; buh; buh
I-I-I-I am the the the rap Hannah
Ma Mon-Montana so fix your antenna
I keep three hoes but don't call me Santa
And I am flyer then reindeers in the winter

I get crazy
I get crazy

Nicki Minaj:
So I got the bad bitch mentality 'cause I just came from another galaxy
I be with the president up in the White House
If we in the oval office then the lights out
'Cause I am the wicked witch I'm the Nickster
And I keep a bad bitch on my jickster
But I leave her in a second for a thicker
Rockstar little mama with a guitar
I am Nicki LMNO-winsky
I mean my name ring bells like Tinky
I mean tinker
Tell that nigga link her
'Cause I'm looking for some good brains from a thinker

Weezy:
1 2 3rd Floor
Hospital Bound
Niggas is doors and I knock niggas down
Straight jacket crooked, I hear you lookin'
I promise I'm hard, and I swear you pussy
I ain't crazy, no, yes I am
Right up in the coo-coo nest I land
I'm' fly now eat my bird shit
Yeah I'm crazy, I'm' crazy 'bout your bitch
Wild animal on my bewildered shit
I love brain so I'm looking for a nerd bitch
It's Nicki Minaj, the superb witch
And Weezy F. Baby, no, Weezy F. Crazy

I got my mind on my money and I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper.

Brinx:

East side resident oh so evident
Brinx Billy ride cousin black on black phantom 26s on the side of 'em
Ninas on the side of em, goonies on the side of 'em
Anybody can get it boy be careful on the side of them
These niggas are burial guns no fearial
Money hungry honey with me if you holla she gonna carry you
Flyer than a aerial vechical gerital
Sittin' on my feet when I'm stuntin' on them people
I tell no fables everything chillin'
Fax machines office max see me for that paper
You workin' for short bread ain't my money long younging
Bitch I'm on trappin' more digits than a phone number different time zones on 'em Kill them niggas lyrically
Left side of my closet look invaded by Italy
Right side Paris left side flaggin' paper is my main chick me and money married
And that's all a nigga know bitch that's why them brand new niggas is all up on my old shit

(Speaking: Nicki Minaj)
That's what I did I came up out the truck, you know what I'm sayin'

Young Money, Nicki Minaj it's the ninja, Harajuku Barbie and all of that
Nah I'm sayin' all that me gettin' money you writin' disses we gettin' money

Hit me my limousine, all in your magazine
And when I come them better lean like Promethazine

And tell Michelle I got my eye on Barack Obama
Tryna get that Madonna, you know, Hannah Montana
And you can find me sittin' Indian style with the Dalai Lama
Konichiwa I get my yin and say sayonara
I'm meditating, I'm in conhoots with a higher power
Mind on money mi-mi-mind on my money yo
Mind on my money mi-mi-mind (yo ho rai que quo)
Mind on money aye, mind on my money babe
How does this money taste? Whining on money's face
You see the signs and the teachings
If you ain't know well this is grinding season
Now and go get your gangs signs, throw it up!
Where all my niggas on them bikes? Throw it up
We don't care what you say, we ain't going away
My niggas bring the heat, it's not a summer day
So mind on my motherfuckin' money, my mind on my motherfuckin' money.

(Speakin: Busta Rhymes)
Ayo I speak foreign languages and shit but the language I speak is that money language (laughs) flipmode bitch
Brinx I like how we do the brinx truck job on these niggas homey
Time after time again I like niggas and remind niggas how I hold out on motherfuckers

Niggas out here frontin' about they bread you can't trust it niggas my money so Stupid call me warren Busta buss nigga
Glad it ain't a toss and everything about me butters I've been counting money so Long I see dollar signs and different colors
My money is smear and smothered your money you hear me brother
Been about that bread like I was broke or still in the gutter
And in case you ain't know there will be no replacement and them bags of arab Money I got stashed in the basement face it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Yo, SB. I think it's my time...
You know why? My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed
Against me will prosper. And I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm still the one to beat
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!

Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down!)
Hit 'em on a walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or a real real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the Tec 9
Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex line
Hit 'em with a tommy so my niggas call me Kimmy and I always the jammy in the Trunka of the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei
So I call him splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis (?)
This is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinsky
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me)

If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'm a go hard
If you was as real as me, you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin' around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!

Lil Wayne:
From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me just like vibe and no water
Better yet, like Bubba, no shrimp. but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm that just a summa bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
It yee ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't cover my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nick
It ain't fuckin' with me it ain't fuckin' with Nick
Your girlfriend, her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nick, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my Le Bitch (?) cause, I swear y'all's a fuckin' trip
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger just punch a bitch
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country bitch

Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'm a go hard
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in your throne
I done flipped the trunk on her
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin' around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard!

Hear the Devil callin',

It's like I get chills down my spine when I'm near him,
Mad, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him,
I don't need the preachers,
I'm the high priestess.
Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you.",
Bxtches know I beast this,
I'm the fashionistist.
And they know I stay around the white like a groom,
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom.
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high on my own supply,
Yellin' "Rasta, all right! " when I'm ridin' by,
See I used to be the wife of a king,
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.
Now that I'm a boss bxtch,
It's a win-win,
Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin,
Now I get'cha ching and my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding.

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' [x2]

Get down, get down, get down down,
Get d- get down, get down, get down down,

Get down, get down on the ground,

Man, fxck a P0,
And fxck a C0,
'Bout to set it off like Cleo,
Mad they done tapped my trio,
Begged my skio,
Heard the bxtch lyin' like Leo.
Anyway, I'm the ninja,
Kawasaki blazin',
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians.
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son,
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done.
'Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin',
The young Chaka Khan, yes - I am every woman.
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in,
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees,
The leprachaun sees what my palm reads.
And if my heart seize, please call my auntie,
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin' [x2]

Can you hear the yellin'?
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e.
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me.

Tell 'em that I'm black, Chinese, and butter pecan

Pull up in the Range I'm givin' 'em mo' reasons (mo reasons)
Hit up Lil Wayne boo I'm in the four seasons (four seasons)

Decorated his office with flowers and pink cheers (chairs)

Hot dammit it's a miracle,
Please adjust the temperature
I switched up the interior in my European 50
Damn Gucci lyrical
Nah I ain't lyrical but my bracelet is crazy but my necklace is a miracle
Blacker than Nigeria,
With brand new material
Counting a quarter million while I'm pouring a bowl of cereal
Fresher than your ever were richer than a year ago with
Three dollars a skittle but it's eight hundred a cheerio
I was error and rude same color as a prune yellow
Chain look like the moon and my old school is maroon
Roon hearing ert-ert when it skert 26's on the skirt's
And a bird with a flirt
You can tirt I got twerk I keep work
In my birds I got bird I got bricks

Now my ice game is superb so them hoes can suck my dick

Ask Rocko ask Gucci, ask Gucci, Gucci bandana

I'm such a girl, I'm such a girly girl
I'm sippin' on my milkshake with this swirly swirl
Excuse me mister put some cheeries in my cups
I take my shirt off and watch the boys go nuts
Boys goes nuts boys-boys goes nuts
All the dope boys all the boys wanna fuck
My niqqa S Beezy keep my wrist breezy
Why would I go hard when this shit is so easy

Where that white blow, why they copy my flow
If it's not young money, it's a typo
There them lights go, we don't talk to five-o

We don't t-t-talk, talk 2 five-o

I'm sorry I don't wanna take a walk with ya
Matta fact, I ain't tryna talk 2 ya
We ain't got no business, so what we talkn for
It ain't no need to bring me in for no interrogation
Cause about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving?
At the precinct writing statements on which your house is the station (damn)
Not I, tattle tellin' is for homos
Besides, that's the number 1 Young Money no no
Police, we don't chat with them
We ain't got no wrap for them
You in the cop car point niggas out from the back of them (There he go)
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I'm black, and yous a fuckin' goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the half way house and ask your supervisor

Where my straitjacket at... I'm a psycho

So excuse my twitches (excuse me)
Lemme get that brewski, niggas know them bitches can't do it like I dooski
I just pull up, chuck the deuce in some blue denim, and I just heard he running with the lieutenant
I'm the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia
Yes uh huh, Washington
Betta ask around, 'cause I'm what's popping-ton
I'm who they think about, playin' with they pee pee
Gotta count sheep because I'm never sleepy
Guess I'm the chief, you can find me in my teepee... BITCHES!

Break a nigga jaw if he turn too informant

So I'm a bring you to the bottom of the ocean [uh chuuch]
I hear you preachin' like a fuckin' reverend
Should killed you in the first place... no second guessin'
Coulda killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck 'em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect 'em
I could AK attack 'em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
'Cause I'm God's gift like a present
For 1 don't try me I could give you two lessons you peasants get murdered if you do test 'em
Gudda Gudda bitch!

C'mon now, they done... they know I do it
They know when I do it it get done
Two sticks in my bun, but, but first of all
When I say two sticks in my bun, I mean
That when I put a bun in my hair
Like when I put my hair in a ponytail
And I wrap my hair in a bun
I put two Chinese sticks in my bun with the Chinese bang
Cause y'all y'all minds is in the gutter
That's what two sticks in my bun mean, okay?
But Holiday you already know, y'knahmsayin?
They heard that hard spittin', they heard that fast shit
NOWWWW, y'know, you gotta slow it down for them y'know
Umm, they wanna hear me sing
Y'know behind every bad bitch there's a really sweet girly, girl
There's a really sweet, Harajuku Barbie, and umm
Now it's time for them to hear me [inhales]
Get all nice and soft and, moist

Oh I had 'em sick better get that coffin

Where's my hat and where's my straitjacket

Just 'cause this lil' piggy went to the market
Market except they marketed sex
My market with the ex they talkin' them checks now

Why when I needed it why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive? frontin' like you friendly
Why did you fear that? held my career back
Kick it like air max I don't wanna hear that
But now I see, see, see, see all ya run down
Nigga better have my money by sun down
Cause now when I come through I'm stlyin' on em
It's like I got hotter then islands on em
They say she got colder than igloos. did she?
I'm in a GT she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi tell that bitch jump if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when the bell go DING!

Envy

I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me love my neighbor
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nic of time it just dawned on
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win
Maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn
Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me 'cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill

Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D.
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah follow the rules, go and say my prayers and get ready for school)

Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted
(I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?
AYYYYYY! Can anybody hear me?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Yeah yeah uh huh
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin'
I heard she move dem thangs
I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that mean she give him brain
She trynna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks tha same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she frum Queens right?
And what's her nationality, she Chinese right?
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT
She ain't da next bitch, tell dat bitch fall back!
See I'm a hater, I go hard... listen let's begin
You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian
And she ain't neva comin' out, look at currency
But every time she do a interview you know I run to see
She get me so sick it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up thisis50... MTV... hit up BET
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki

Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day you'll remember dis
One day wen we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is, good enough for music biz

For you, for you

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens for me that means you
Just gotta a betta opportunity to do you
They don't understand these labels look at numbers is statistics
I lose, you lose, mines just legastic
Any way, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetins (kyea)
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Common, you can ask Chris
Lady when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's duckin' the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swirvin the mazeratzi
Stay around da white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-poppin' on my poppers so the cops see... BITCHES!

Still I rise
Still I fight
Still I mite crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!
One day you'll remember dis
One day wen we reminisce
Nothin' I do ever is, good enough for music biz

I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin 
So far ahead, these bums is laggin' 
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin' 
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon 
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon 
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin' 
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been? 
Yeah, I said it, has-been 
Hang it up, flatscreen 
(Haha) Plasma 
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma 
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine 
I got bars, Xenocin 
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt 
And I'll kick that hoe, punt 
Forced trauma, blunt 
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front 
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it 
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with 
You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock 
I am a movie, camera block 
You outta work, I know it's tough 
But enough is enough 

I feel Pretty (3x) 
And witty 
And Gay
And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight 

(Eminem) 

I ain't into S&amp;M, but my whip's off the chain 
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame 
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain 
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame 
You don't like it then peel off, bitch 
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut 
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off 
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off 
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod 
Quit hollerin' "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it 
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad 
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra 
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch 
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad 
With fake tits and a bad dye job 
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad 
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod 
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed 
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her 
Look, two pees and a tripod! 
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod? 
Kick it back in its face, my God 
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd 
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) 

I feel uglyx3

Slut don't touch me or hug me 
I'm mad And I pity Any girl who gets with me tonight 

(Nicki Minaj) 

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight? 
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite 
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike 
Now all my ***** gettin' bucked, overbite 
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's 
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs 
I call the play, now do you see why? 
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli 
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin' 
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin' 
Overseas, church, Vatican 
You at a stand, still, mannequin 

(Eminem) 

All you li'l faggots can suck it 
No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets 
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend 
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if 
You have the same passion that I have 
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass 
You assdicks had gastric bypass 
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass 
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!) 
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony 
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass 
You know what time it is, so why ask? 
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class 
It's (high class) meets (white trash) 

I feel Pretty (3x) 
And witty 
And Gay 
And I pity Any girl who isent me tonight

I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply going to drive you crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you crazy

(Young Buc)
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes
Swingin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tatooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley
Lets go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi
Then go pull up at the afterparty
I think we make a perfect couple
But you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feeling like "maybe she the wrong woman"
Think I'm'a be chasin' the chicken head you own somethin'
Your toes painted hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Making decisions shorty good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keep showin' me that thong
Before I head home
I'm'a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on (holla at your boy)

(Lloyd Banks)
Bitches be frustrated with the baller
Wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she needs someone to spoil her
It gets annoying from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know we'll be friends and nothing more
She loves it when I'm in town
Hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear down
Next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin' the ground
Just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin' 'n' moving cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a 40 year old feel like a young lady

I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame
Fall in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer would she remain
Surrounding me hounding me trying to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend I'm your homie.

(50 Cent)
(Yeah) What would fuck me up more
Watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk she hypnotize me with her hips (yeah) man
I sweet talking her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right right
Look I'm legit now used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefit of world tours
Big house big Benz girl it yours
Mink coats Italian shoes stones with no flaws
You ain't go to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't Indulge in my past fuck what happened before you
Cause their be some homies gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here let my touch on you I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you and you can ride on
We can do it all the night
We can have a balla tonight

I wanna get to know you
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin'
I'm simply gonna drive you, crazy

I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, lady
One dose of my lovin'
I'm really gonna drive you, crazy

(x2)
I wanna be your lover
I really understand you, baby
I want to be your lover
I really understand you, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of 
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Uh... uh, yo...
He the type to pop tags, and be cockin' the brim;
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym,
And he keep a du-rag, keep the wave on swim;
Wa-wa-waves on swim, so they hate on him...

Anyway, I think I met him sometime before,
In a different life, or where I record...
I mean... he was Adam, I think I was Eve,
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree...

S-S-S on my chest, 'cause I'm ready to save him,
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him...
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him;
When he call me "Mama", "Lil' Mama", I call him "Baby"...

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;
You got me wantin' more and ma-ma-more of 
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Mm-hmm... yo... yo...
He the type to keep a couple hundred grand in a rubber band;
Just left Money Gram in the Lemon Lam...
Hot damn, make me scream like Summer Jam;
I mean, that nigga must be from the motherland...

Anyway, I think I met him in the sky;
When I was a geisha, he was a samurai...
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai;
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly...

S-S-S on my chest, let me get my cape on;
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon...
Konvict! Just like Akon,
'Cause you know the snitches be putting the Jake-on...

Shawty, I'ma only tell you this once: you the illest; (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
And for your lovin', I'm a die hard like Bruce Willis... (Ba-pa-dot-dot-doh...)
You got spark, you, you got spunk;
You, you got something all the girls want...
You're like a candy store, and I'm a toddler;

Your love, your love... (Yeah...) Your love, your love... (Yeah...)
Your love, your love... your love, your love...
Your love, your love... your love, your love...

Find me in the dark, I'll be in the stars;
Find me in your heart - I'm in need of your love...
Your love... your love, your love...
Baby, you're the illest...
Your love...

Your love...

Yo Cassie
You a bad bitch I'mma call you Lassie
Just left the tour last date Tallahasse
Don't mind me
Even witcha GPS couldn't find me
Lookin' at this boy I'mma call him McDreamy
I was wonderin' if he got a good Dick Cheney
Got a Lamborghini so the doors go high
In a button down Chris Brown bow tie!

(Cassie's part...)

Is that my cue
I'm lookin' for some brain to boost my IQ
I'm like 5'2
My SAT sc-scores was high too
But I don't wanna brag, I Loui Vuitton bagged him

Hopped out the jag proceeded to shag-shagged him
Thought he was a queen I dr-dr-dragged him
Dodged to the room and whipped out the magnum
Slim, trim, also light skin
Now P-P-Peter put the pipe in
Yes sir I am that bitch
Fuck you Silly like the rabbit
*Giggles*
Giddy Up Giddy Up
Now wake Diddy up Diddy up Diddy up

I got that hard Gucc
You know these bitches easy
I got that cold flu
I got that itchy sneezy
You in that Mitsubishi
I'm in that Bentley GT
I'm taking trips with papi
You walkie talkie copy
I got them pookie feins
Might rock some juicy jeans
I mean some juicy sweats
Maybe some lose your giusepp's
I play foul no free throw
Bitch I ball no pre-show
Dead ass no peep show!
Brought a run pronto
With a front condo
Daughter, son, John Doe
Watching tele-mundo
Flyer than a rocket
Money in my Polly Pocket
What you copping
Keep that work inside my Pippy Long Stockings
Bitch!

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's not chipped, we're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered
Mariah, Young Money
Nicki Minaj, you're such a Barbie

Yo, Mariah, I was in a million dollar meetin' he was cheatin'
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away while the mice will play
L-O-L, smiley-face, have a nice day

'Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop censoring that contraband
'Cause you was penny-pinchin', my accounts laced
Attention, about-face

I thought we had something special and we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walkin' by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you're on a sofa and I'm on the TV

Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo

Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house

When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby, I break

So look who's cryin' now, boo-hoo-hoo
Talkin' about you're missin' your boo, hoo-hoo
I know you ain't getting it, I know you ain't hittin' it
No, you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spittin' it

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you'll wonder who I'm messin' with
While you ain't next to me
I'm going bye, so pay the consequences
'Cause you acting all ignorant

So you ashamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house, when I break, I break

Stylin' on them big B's with the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top dogs, yeah, we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose

They be like, "She next", Kawasaki, T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left? Let his momma pick it up
Might back-up on it, vroom-vroom, with a pick-up truck

That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmello Jag
I bob and weave and hit them with the Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like I'm hotter than a yellow tag

'Cause when I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this s***
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder can rebuild this s**

When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two lego blocks even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again

When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break

You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
(I told you, I put, I put your stuff on the side walk)
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
(I will go over every nook and cranny with a pick-up truck)
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
(Like straight up and down, this is Nicki Minaj, if they ask about me, Young Money)
They're collecting my bags, baby, I break boy

Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break

Take it slow but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roam
I turned him to gold and it took him higher
But I'll be your day-dream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to Paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones I can feel you
Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go

Deep in my bones I can feel you
Take me back to a time when we knew how to wait
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the backroom hideaway

To know what you want, know you'll never truly have it

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

When I went away, saw your face in my rear-view
I know that look on your face, that I had lost you

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

You promised, I promised
I never knew I could be this selfish
Nights downtown, it's a new town
But I keep thinking I see your face in the crowd
But you're not here and you won't be
'Cause you love me enough to let go of me

New York City, please go easy on me tonight
New York City, please go easy on this heart of mine
'Cause I'm losing my lover to the arms of another
New York City, please go easy on me tonight

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
All along the bottom of the deep sea
Can I shake this feeling?
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Freely feeling everything
You had me reeling
Can I shake this feeling?

Tonight, light a fire
We'll be flying up and higher
Burning bright, taking flight
As we leave all our worries behind
It is something special you have
If you didn't know, but now just

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Make your ass shake like a waterbed

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?

Make your ass shake like a waterbed
Can I shake this feeling?

I got something to say
A confession of me
I've been led astray
Tried so hard to change
But I'm set on my ways
My words mean nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

I just couldn't resist
It was the moment of bliss
I know it's hard to forgive
It's too late for changes
All this time I've wasted
Words mean nothing, nothing again

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
I promised I'd be good

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

I promised I'd be good
But I can't help myself from these temptations
When they come, there's nothing I can do
I promised I'd be good
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
So when I fall, I will fall to you

Down to my last match fire I'll touch just to feel
Why's it easier to burn than it is to heal?

Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I've been looking for answers I don't want to hear
Chest to chest with you I'm staring into a mirror

Out in the cold you have been
I've begged you to come back in
But I can't do this again

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm
I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

I can't
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you
What would I do?
What I wouldn't do to save you

I can't keep you from harm
But I'm set on fire to keep you warm
I can't go on and on
Setting fires to keep you warm

Fighting flames of fire
Hang onto burning wires
We don't care anymore
Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go

We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, "Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window"
'Cause this is all we know

'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know

Hey, I was doing just fine just before I met you
I drank too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as the good as the day as I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-One Eighty-Two song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay?

I know it breaks your heart
I moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I can't stop

So baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older

Bend your chest open so I can read your heart
I need to get inside, or I'll start a war
Wanna look at the pieces that make you who you are
I wanna build you up and pick you apart

I'm gonna love you inside out

Let me see the dark sides as well as the bright
I'm gonna love you inside out

And can I touch your face before you go
I collect your scales but you don't have to know

But now there's nobody by my side

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don't let me down, down, down

So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

Yeah, don't let me down

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You know, I'm sorry
I won't make it to your party
Got caught up in my own selfishness
It won't let me be a part of this
And I know I've started
Drifting off every second
I can't wait to leave as soon as I arrive
I count the seconds

Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Down and down we go
And we'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

(You know, I'm sorry)
(I'm sorry)
No, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

"Give me time, give me space, give me reason."
That's what you tell me when you're leaving
Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

And I know you say you want it now (want it now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though

And I know you say you need me now (need me now)
Give me the runaround (runaround)
Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

So I build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again
Build the bridges up, the bridges up
Build the bridges up again, oh

She wants to break up every night
She wants to break up every night
Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it
She wants to break up every night
Then tries to fuck me back to life
I cannot help it if I like the way she makes me feel it

I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

Dropping bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hits you all at once
I'm already tired and it's the morning
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughing
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darling, I have to cut you off

Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

You say you've regret the way you acted
Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Just don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault
I won't take the bait or these excuses that you're using
Don't say, don't say you're human

You don't gotta say it, I know you ain't stayin' over
And I won't even mention the fact that you're never sober
I never know which side I'm gonna get tonight
And the closer we get, the less I think I know you

But you're just my type
The kind that only calls me late at night
You can't decide if you'll be yours or mine
I hate to say it, but you're just my type

No, you're not the one, but you're all I want, yeah
People say I'll get hurt, I don't know what they're so afraid of

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, "Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out"
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought "How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else"

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are better

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are better

It's 5 AM and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

It's 6 AM, I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You got real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone

I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything that did is function
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can go from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young

Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can go from this, yeah

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young

We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive

Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never

Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young

Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive

Na na na na na oh na na na na na na na na

It's been a minute since I saw you boy
Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when your around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

It's funny how things could change
But still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby here I go again

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I neva gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize this happenin'
Baby here I go again

Here I Go Again

Still remember how you make me weak
How so hard to find the words to speak
I just can't excape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
But I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

Haters gonna hate

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Once was a time you and i
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinkin' that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gunna cry these tears
I'm never gunna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This times the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did for my heart went through bad
But I'm still standin tall as I walk away
And you know that its true when you hear me say
It's over, its through
And nothin' you can do boy its sad but its true

It's the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gunna cry these tears
I'm never gunna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This times the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Good Byeee No Baby
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts... like a knife

It's the last time your ever gunna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gunna cry these tears
I'm never gunna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This times the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
It's over its through nothin' you can do and wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby goodbye
Never gunna never gunna cry no more
Goodbye goodbye

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Baby slow down just here me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need push no need to rush
You know you had me from hello

When it comes to my heart I don't play
Baby boy can't you see the stop sign
Your movin much to fast
Baby love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

Baby if your willing to wait
We just take our time
Don't you know that it's getting late
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
Its mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby if your willing to wait
We can just take our time

Boy can't you see I'm not tryna be
The girl who gets taken for a ride
If you take your time and you will find
There's so much more to me inside
And just say there's no need to delay
Your telling me to trust you
Boy you know I want to baby
But my heart gets so recently break
Before we take this very far show me who you really are

Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (the sun)

On how you can't escape it
The moment takes you it never lets you Go!

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train, just the way he said my name
The brotha hada alot a game, and he open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride, Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

(Hook) There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady, gives me everything I need
I don't care whos hating on me, 'cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down, but every time that he's around
My heart don't lock down, I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

(Rap)
T-H-U-G in ya life baby
One in a million that's what you are to me
Anda I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got that tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be alot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving and loving that's all I'm giving

Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know it's the real thing, if you don't whatever
And I know its meant to be

There's a thug in my life, how'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life, and it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight, I'm gonna give him everything

Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Took a chance, roll the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you read a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when, we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know
There come a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can't you see
It's the way it's gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary everyday thing
Now I know that when this ride is so amazing
When it's wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah
Now I know
I know

Because in the mornin my true love is what I wanna see

Teasin me, pleasing me, easily boy, I'm addicted to you
Got a have ya for all the things that you do
It something bout this feeling, it's crazy,
Amazing that stays with me all night and day,
Makes my temperature rise
Boy your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand
It's so vibe it's your style it the way the that you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, its electric, this felling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried ??

You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin' but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast I'm a afraid can't escape there's no way
Never had a feeling like this b4

It's amazing how you drive me crazy
Boy keep doin' what you're doin'
'Cause you're really gettin' through to me
Day and night babe you know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and you know you got me hypnotized

Lala lala lala lala, oh
You know, I never felt like this before
Lala lala lala lala, oh
Just feels like somethin' real

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question and you're, of course, the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you, I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock

Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

SOS please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making (Y-O-U) this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

SOS please somebody help me, yeah
It's not healthy for me to feel this way
Y-O-U are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it (all of the time)
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me (best of me), so now I'm losing it

Lala lala lala lala, oh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala

Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie

Emotions come and go
Almost how the wind will blow
There so little in this world to trust in

Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love but its really only lustin'

So you see you and me
We're gettin' close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie

Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't
Kisses don't lie

You whisper in my ear
But are your words sincere
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

So you see you and me
We're gettin' close to danger zone
Show me how tell me now
Should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And its tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide
Cause baby kisses don't lie

Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Tellin' you it's the truth don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No they don't

Kisses don't
No they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide

Story of my life
Searching for the right,
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Ask if I'm gonna be out late

I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door,
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love,
His trust.
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this, anymore
Ooh.
Anymore

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer
No, no, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride

I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (oh yeah)
'Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had
I just think it's so sad

Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down
See them try to mess to hurt you
And work you
Anything to bring ya down

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (what you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when your on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life

Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They not there for you
They don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know its true
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when your not around
Its just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I never should of waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye

Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its rewards, I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye

Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you I die
So I'll Lay here with you till the final goodbye

Ooh Yeah

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be
When I look into your eyes
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter more like butter
Since I met you boy my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

Boy you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking baby your the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa ho yeah

My bestfriends tell me Rihanna
What's got into you
I say Rihandra I can't explain
These feelings I'm going through
Tell me girl it's not like you to fall this way
I try my best to wear a disguise
But it's written on my face

(J-Status)
Yeah
It's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna
Baby girl for you missing the song yeah

Let me take to jamaica
And introduce you to the real thing
For the loving where you are
So baby you're my number 1 my number 2
So if its loving that you want
Baby you should make me your boo

Don't understand the meaning

I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you and not to mention good love that you give to me I think about it constantly no I
Won't apologize for feeling like I do it's just the simple facts of life I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you every minute of the day I'm addicted to what your giving me boy
It's killing me when it comes to love I'm not trying share you might think I'm greedy but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

I understand that you got your crew but I've got something in mind for you make you lose all track of
Time guaranteed to blow your mind I don't care what anybody got to say maybe they never had it quite this
Way let them talk and criticize they all need to recognize They might see I'm a bit extreme to need you
Night and day but what I feel can't be consealed there ain't no other way

No other way

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
And it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother,
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line
To the story of me and you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that still remain after you were gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the TV
Boy it ain't easy
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
Turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you

Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Still not over you

Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' New To Say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though there disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And Show me what you feel
So tell me if you
Want to take a chance
On something real

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything
If I asked him to
To take all my dreams
And Make them true
Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me
Just like me

Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the Answer here tonight
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find the Answer here tonight

When the whole world's turnin' left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a lil' different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for Second Best
Could it be a boy like you

Show me all the reasons that you
Ought to be with a girl like me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Here we lay face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
And I'm wondering who will be the first
To say what we both know
We're just holding on to could have beens
And we should be letting go.

It feels like you're a million miles away
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending,
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
Cause even though you're here,
It feels like you're a million miles away.

Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
From what we were just like the seasons love has changed
And every I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.

(Music Plays:)

We can try to talk it over
But we walked that road before
Boy, our song has played its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door.

Cause, everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby

Be that one you share your everything when no one's around

Saying you'd be there to do whatever it takes
To make more brand new days of my life
My troubles would be over if I made you my wife

What about it?

So I wouldn't mind being here to here on the script

Little lady you was right from the ghetto

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Whoa yay ooh

Baby please we don't have to explain the reasons
This is me I know your mind can change like the seasons
Go your way I know the world is calling your name boy
It's okay 'cause what we got it ain't gonna change boy

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

You and me we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying to hard to play cool
I don't mind I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time sometimes the heart rearranges

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

Ooh heyyay

There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder boy and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there'right there

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothin'
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?

Don't want to be another craze
How about rather not see and I turn my face
Don't want to leave you unfinished
And resting on the noise that you left
I don't want to leave you mistaken, forsaken
Lying with the rest

I don't want you to be another
Touch, you talk the conversation
I don't want you to be another
Reason for me to leave this situation

Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started

I don't want to be a woman that
You wish you never met
I don't want you to kill my name
And ask if I'm hovering him
I won't send and gather dust
In the corners of your world
Cause believe me, when you leave me
It won't be a minute too soon

Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started

I don't want you to be another
Touch, you talk the conversation
I don't want you to be another
Reason for me to leave this situation

Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started

You, and you alone
You, and you alone
Have the power to be the master of your life

You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to

You... you alone

Granted you're taking me for a sucker
When I am not
Gradually, we'll patch up mends and I'll make you see
What I've got
Apparently you're taking me for a slip on
You've gotta tie me up
Eventually you will tamper mends, I'll make you see
I am enough

You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to

Obviously, you're taking me for what suits you
When I don't
With slow ease I'll show you disgraced, you were on my knees
You know I won
Foolishly, you're taking me for a sleeper
When I'm quite awake
Evidently we've not through been me, your intense scene
And you'll now break

You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You, and you alone
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You, and you alone

How can I climb inside you
The way that you're climbing inside me
How could I ever deny you
The way that you never deny me
How can I climb inside you
Touching the parts that people really see
How can I open and find you
And feel you the way that you want me to feel

I want you to know what I'm thinking of
I want you to read my mind before I write it
I want you to know that I have stories to tell
I wanna tell you a little bit more

How do I get to align with you
(?) times I will see
If we can piece together something
Or something else that will be

Can't believe that you're less
I'm still not against your will
A change that you really want too
If I pour it all out
Will you still have no doubt
There's a reason or two that you are too

I want you to know what I'm thinking of
I want you to read my mind before I write it
I want you to know that I have stories to tell
I wanna tell you a little bit more

How can I climb inside you
The way that you're climbing inside me
How could I ever deny you
The way that you never deny me
How can I climb inside you
Touching the parts that people really see
How can I open and find you
And feel you the way that you want me to feel

I want you to know what I'm thinking of
I want you to read my mind before I write it
I want you to know that I have stories to tell
I wanna tell you a little bit more

Can't believe that you're less
I'm still not against your will
A change that you really want too
If I pour it all out
Will you still have no doubt
There's a reason or two that you are too

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Your insensitivity is your personality
A trade that's least favourite
Ha ha funny, you think you're so funny
But you hurt my feelings
We've had some good dealings
What have I done recently to make you so mean to me?
I'm oversensitive you say but I think you're nasty today
You make me feel nasty like a control freak
I just want to feel helpful like I'm needed
A sense of reason
You tell your friends I'm a fucking kook -
Look how long it took
I've been like this all the time
You don't know what it's like to be me -
You're not paranoid, neurotic - you're free
I don't like me much anymore
You make me feel a burden
You make me feel like a bore

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Well I live here with you
In, in a kind of "yes, will do"
Oh what part of now don't you understand
I'm showing you well apparent
Yeah I get the bluff if I'll get out
No room for three, you, me and your doubts
One of us has got to leave
And it'll sure be me

And I think we could have a situation
We could have a situation

Any reason we can't just settle around now
Yeah, ok, and how?
Rather than shout and praise
(?) with them, not without (?)
Oh, what part of our old tune don't you understand
I think I made it clear that you're in the mend
In the mend

Oh, we could have a situation
Oh, we could have a situation

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Yes, you can take that to heart
It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
You can make it a big issue
Make it a battle of your own and that's ok

You can feign a distant familiarity
You say you understand the similarity
You think you see me with great clarity
But you're acting me, not necessarily

Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

Yes, you can call that a start
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
Yes, your deceit is an art
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway

You say you have the best intentions
You fill me with fickle suggestions
Logic is fired by inventions
But your concern is much more than you mention

Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

You say you know my situation
You say you've been confused by my complication
You think my soul makes negotiation
But you don't see my hesitation

Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know

People are talking, well that's nothing new
And some things will never change
Stories are turning away from the truth
But people will stay the same

It's only natural that we go on
To meet with the days that will come
It's only natural that we all carried forward
So step on, go on
Get rising like the morning sun

There's no need to take it to heart
There's no need to take it to heart
Only the truth can tear you apart
There's no need to take it to heart

Well stand tall and (?)
And don't let it get you down
Make them all feel (?)

I sometimes believe that everything I dream
Will one day be my reality
I sometimes think that every move I make
Will gather in shape in my reality

I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality

I sometimes search for signs my dreams can work
Until I stand alert with my reality
I sometimes look in paradise by the book
To give back what I took from my reality

I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That I will one day see
A beautiful reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That I will one day see
A beautiful reality

Beautiful, beautiful reality
A beautiful reality
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful reality

Like a new winter's coat
I'm wearing your last embrace
Like a cold quenching glass of water
I hold a clear picture of your face

Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty

I'm hearing your last telephone call
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest
I hear your invitation to see it all
Better written I am smitten no protest

Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be bored and lonely
Soon I'll be bored and lonely

Like a story well told
Your conversation can hold me or soothe me
Like a funny time to share you were there
And your comfort and support me

Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be restless and weary
Soon I'll be restless and weary

Like another man
I want hold you within me
Like a good day without care
I just want you to last
I just want you to last

I'm tasting the last glass of your wine
The sweet taste linger left on lips
I think of your kisses with mine
The sweet taste lingers left on lips

Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you? (Quickly)
Where are you?
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed

I, I, I never would have thought it would end this way, I lied
I never have believed that we would separate
What we have now is how it stands
And now I wish you'll try to make it stay
The way we are is here and now
I wish you'd make the most of all we have today

Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot

I did not believe, I did not mean to hurt you no more
I never meant to let you down, down
Though the silver lining wears through
I still do not mean to hurt you, no
When the sound of your voice is not ringing through
Beginning to question whether I should be around

Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot

Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot

My mother's afraid of the subway
It's a living bad dream
I hold her hand as the doors close
And she pales and stifles a scream

Ali's afraid of ad-libbing
Of improvising at jams
She is not very happy right now
And spends all her money on grams

Ade is afraid of commitment
So Carla dumped him today
She is very disappointed
She was hoping he'd beg her to stay

Ayo, he just wants a girlfriend
He's afraid of dying alone
He doesn't go out very much
Sits at home a lot getting stoned

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

Ella is worried about her weight
She won't eat in public anymore
She is fucking her ex again
When they've finished, she sleeps on the floor

Nate has a heart of gold
But give it away he will not
His mother abandoned him at ten
It's a pain he has never forgot

Mary's afraid of herself
Her sentences often cut half
She will never give her own opinion
She's afraid that people might laugh

And I am afraid of sharks
I will not swim out past my head
And sometimes I worry my boyfriend will die
My first love is already dead

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

Candy is having a baby
She fears she will be like her mom
Her friends say, "Relax, take a deep breath
And march to a different drum"

Sachas afraid of her Marco
She think's that it's all her fault
But if he did what he does to a stranger
He'd be locked up and charged with assault

You see, fear is only holding us back
Look closely amongst all your peers
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
It is fear, it is fear, it is fear

Eat food to satisfy my hunger
I drink water to quench my thirst
Use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
And prick with pin to watch it burst
To make noise I use my breathe
To unlock doors I use a key
When I'm looking for something I use my eyes
Use booze to unlock me

Sweep so I can sleep (x2)
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep

Wear shoes so I can run
As to avoid the broken glass
Wear the pants because they suit me
And to discourage the pinchin' of ass
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh
I'll close the door to have a cry
They say that change and pain is a positive thing
Have I changed since you died

Sweep so I can sleep (x2)
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep

Don't ask my why I smoke I don't know
But I drink to get drunk (x4)

I'm sitting in the car again
Waiting for you
You said you'd be a minute
But you've been twenty two
See you've got to do your hair
And get it just right
Sometimes you're in the bathroom
For half of the night

And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do

Now I'm sitting by the phone again
Waiting for your call
You said you'd phone at two
And it's a quarter past four
Now I'm standing out the front again
It's late at night
And I'm truly sick to death of sleazy men
Undressing me with their eyes

And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do

So I'm back from the theater
I watched the show alone
See, I waited for you and I missed half act one
Have you never heard of the phone?
I don't like being taken for granted
I'm too nice for my own good
You see I do what I say, and I say what I do
Is it too much to expect that you could?
I wish you would

I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
It's the usual coup
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't missing nothing for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Without a sound ever heard
Without a lesson I've learned
You're foolish
And diluted

Too many lies have you burned
Where there's eyes to be found
This seems life's underground

But even if you had it all
You would find
I could never let you stay

'Cause you blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away

If you go
I will stall

Yes I see it
Yes I feel it
You have no questions at all

But if life is truly devoured
I'll strip your bare 'til truth comes out

But even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all

You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
(Repeat) 

Forever is your mind to be naive 
Remember 
It will bring us to our knees 
You blow it all away

'Cause even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all

You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all away
(Repeat)

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Now I don't mind if you find that I'm a shoulder to cry on rely on
But the burden is just too much I'm losing touch with myself and my health

What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me

Now I don't keep you from your sleep I need some ease I'm tired of trying to please
And it seems that my dreams are coming farther and fewer in between

What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me I can heal your problems if you let me

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You took me for granted
You took me, you took me for granted
But I landed back on my feet, back on
My feet
'Cause you don't deserve me, deserve me
You don't have the time that I need
That I want, I deserve
But I got back my nerve
Did what was right for me
I'm using my head not my heart
And I'm starting new
I'm going to get over you, over you

I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you

You happy is all I wanted to see, is all
I wanted to see, to see
And so now that's what
I'm going to be, what I'm going to be
I'll waste some time on me
I gave you my all and you took it
I saw and you gave nothing back
Your mind on another track,
Another track, another track yeah
There are plenty of people out there
Who would care about me
You'll see
You'll see

I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you

Healing is difficult
Often results in psychosomatic
I admit to enjoying drugs
They get rid of tension, boredom and static
Hate those adverse side effects
Forcing the people who love me to scatter
Excuse me for being such a hypocrite
The way I see it really doesn't matter

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

To tell you the truth
I can't believe I love you so much
So much in fact that I don't know whether to weep or wind my watch
I have a sick sense of humor
It amazes me how points it scores
I'm addicted to vice
My best friends are pushers, my boyfriends are whores

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely

Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Waking up next to you
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy
The flies in the front room
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me
If I contract illness
The last thing I want is to pass it to others
Fucking leaves guilt pangs
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?

Judge me feel free
'Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be

It's such a terrible terrible shame
You keep on judging me, in his name
You're so quick to shift the focus
'Cause you can find yourself
In today's frame
But I know he's approve
And I've nothing to prove to you
He smiles down on me lovingly

Just me feel free
'Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be

It's truly sad to see
You suffering so immensely
You need distracting
So you use me conveniently
But I know he'd approve
And I've nothing to prove to you
He smiles down on me lovingly

So naive, it helps me to breathe
Yor smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
I'm your greatest fan

Little man I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with joy
As I grow older, you grow wiser
Watching my mistakes
Memorise where I've gone wrong

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

Little man yor head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day touring
Your imagination
If I live longer you'll grow faster
At recognising the traps that cause
Me such frustration

If they fall way
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me and you'll see
All I want is what is best for you

So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
I'm your greatest fan

Mind you mind me
You thought you could climb me
I'm sorry to cut your rope
Bu in you I've lost all hope

Oh how many times you liked to phone
To see if your seed I could sow

I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without

Mind you mind me
I laught at your transparency
You're my new best friend
Your fucked up life can I mend
Mind you mind me
I find it interesting to see
When I only offer you a smile, oh how
You forget to dial

Believe me, I know you work
Insidiously (repeat)

Mind you mind me, you smile so sweetly
I'd call you an acquaintance stop with
Your exaggeration
Mind you mind me
How things can change is a good week
Call me ruthless
But you stretch the truth oh yes

I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You don't know me
You can't hold me
I'll slip through your hands
I am one single grain of sand

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need

I'm an empty space
I can't be replaced
So when you're finished with this dream
Delete begin to rewrite me

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need

You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
Delete and rewrite me

For those who slept
For those who kept
Themselves jacked up
How Jesus wept
Sunday
Sunday

For those in need
For those who speed
For those who try to slow their minds with weed
Sunday 
Sunday

For those who wake
With a blind headache
Who must be still
Who sit and wait
For Sunday to be Monday

Yeah, it will be OK
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away

For those with guilt
For those who wilt under pressure
No tears over spilt milk
Sunday
Sunday

Sunday

Yeah, it will be OK
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away

Yeah, it will be OK
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away

Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

How you been feeling
It's not about marbles, snakes or glue
How you been healing
Now that we cannot win or lose
So how you been keeping
It doesn't matter whose dad's richest now
How you been sleeping
From the top bunks further to fall down

You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me

What you been doing
Still making the world a better place
Never stopped rueing
Making those tears fall down your face
Making you suffer
Wondering how you got your scars
And only in hindsight
I wish I had taken you in my arms

Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms

You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me (Forgiving the bully)
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me (Forgiving the bully)

She cooks you sweet potato, you don't like aubergine
She knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from grease
She senses you are lonely but still she can't be sure
And so she stands and waits, stands anticipating your thoughts

How can she become the psychic that she longs to be
To understand you
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be
To understand you

He brushes thoroughly
He knows she likes fresh breath
He rushes to the station
He waits atop the steps
He's brought with a mars bar
She will not buy nestle
And later he'll perform
A love-lorn serenade, a trade

How can he become the psychic that he longs to be
To understand you
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be
To understand you

So give her information to help her fill her holes
Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in
Give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin

Now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest
I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed
I hate that you negate me I'm a ghost at beck and call
I'm fading and placating, berate myself for staying

I'm a fool
I'm a fool

He greets this stranger meekly a thing that she accepts
She sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps
He senses she is lonely, she's glad they finally met
They take each other's hands, walk into the sunset

Do you like sweet potato

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Faint light of dawn
I'm listening to you breathing in and out
Needing nothing
You're honey dipped
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world
I can't feel my lips
I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain

Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down

Then all of that's annulled and I'm anyone's
Everyone's, we are one
Your face becomes the sun
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things
Those little things
The little things they bring

I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain

Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes, lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone, we don't need attention

Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

Take it off, you want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay, girl, I feel it too
Let it be, baby breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good, I promise, we'll be so good

Open your hand, take a glass
Don't be scared, I'm right here
Even though, you don't roll
Trust me girl, you wanna be high for this

You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this

You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this

No more pain
You look into my eyes
You can't recognize my face
You're in my world now
You can stay

Nights ends so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
But baby it's okay, they my niggas next door
They be working in the trap, so get louder if you want
Just don't blame it on me girl
That you didn't call your home
Just don't blame it on me girl
'Cause you wanted to have fun

If it hurts to breathe
Open the window
Oh, your mind wants to leave
But you can't go

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the seven

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then, watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
Ain't no offense though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street

La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out

I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking know that
These fucking eyes that I'm staring at

Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And I emptied out my cards to her
Now I'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here

Bring the cups baby I could bring the drank
Bring your body baby I could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words too
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma I'll give you all I got
Get me off on this
I need confidence in myself
Listen ma I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it

So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for one night
Even though you don't love me

Just tell me you love me

Even though you don't love me

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the devil

Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby
So put down your perfume

Bring your love baby I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain

Bring your body baby I could bring you fame

I understand your body wants it
I know your thoughts
Oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl and it's your world
And I'ma let you do it how you wanna
Girl alright baby, right baby
I know you know I know you wanna... with it
Don't be shy pretty, I'll supply pretty
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

With your Louis V bag
Tatts on your arms
High-heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the party
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the party
On your knees
I will not beg you please

Girl, pick up them shoes
I'll race your ass up on them stairs
Just grab a room I swear no one will interfere
Girl bring your friends if you want, we can share
Or we could keep it simple, baby
We can just ride baby, ride baby
I know you know I know you wanna... with it
Don't be shy baby, I'll supply baby
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

With your Louis V bag
Tatts on your arms
High-heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the party
To pluck the feathers of all the birds
You always come to the party
On your knees
I will not beg you please

Ride with it, ride with it
I know, you know, I know you wanna line with it
Don't be shy pretty, I'll supply pretty
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

Won't you lie with it, lie with it
I know you know I know you wanna...
I got you girl, oh I got you girl

Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
I think I'm fucking gone
Rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four
My sessions are the strong on your floor
Shouldn't have fucking rolled
But I fucking rolled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walk through the store
When I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it but I made it that's for sure
For sure, loving I need more, I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it though, sippin' on this
Baby livin' off bliss got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme my attention or I'll start drowning from my wrist

Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you
Oh you
You, oh you
'Cause I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me

I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops then I might get violent
No calls worth stopping
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling I'ma give to you
Oh you, you
Oh you, Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me

Oh I got it girl

I got somethin' to tell you
But don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I can only say one thing:
Girl, I been bad again
Girl, I been bad again

'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use 'em but I'm fading
I forget
I forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

Pick
Up
Your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm
All alone
I'm feeling everything before I got up
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down

Poppin' again
I tried to quit again
I'm always tight wit' somethin' I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
So play what I take, I take what I spend baby
I ain't lyin' to nobody but me
And you
And me
But you especially

Pick

The party's finished and I want you to know

So baby take your clothes off, a chance like this
You may never get to show off, show off
Show off what you talking about
Unless you like to tease, baby
When in reality you don't know how to please, baby
Blue-ball queen, take your fucking seat, baby
Ride it out, now I know you wanna scream, baby
Better than your next man
And if he swingin' I get dumber than the next man
'Cause I don't play
Unless it's keys then I play all day (all day)
You like them keys? We gon' play all day (all day)
Wet dream fry your brain all day (all day)
I think you lost your morals, girl (What?)
But it's okay 'cause you don't need 'em where we're going
In that two-floor loft in the middle of the city
After rolling through the city with me
I promise you gon' see
That I'm only fucking twenty, girl
Amnesia, put your mind in a dream world
What you doing in the bathroom?
I hear noises in the bathroom
Baby, it's okay
We can do it in the living room
Twisting turns in 'em, the only girls that we fuck with
Seem to have twenty different pills in 'em
They tell us that they love us
Even though they want a next man
And the next man's bitch want the third man
Eddie Murphy shit, yeah we trade places
Rehearse lines to them and then we fuck faces
Yeah we know just how to get a buzz
Mix it with the hash, come fuck with us
I'm raw, motherfucker, I'm raw
My love so lost in my niggas, man
These bitches can't touch what we got if they wanted
I'll plug any nigga that'll step, man, I got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Till the ending of our credits, life's such a movie
Filmed independent, us against the city
Please don't get offended when we don't answer your calls
And if you got a problem, come and find us, we can talk about it
What's good, young ho? You about it?
Got a loft right now, you're inside it
You excited?

She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
You don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeah

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Hope you see
It won't mean a thing to me
I've been doing this too long
Baby girl, I've felt it all

If you try to play your luck
Ain't nobody gonna care enough
To catch you fall

So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me

She said please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her
She thanked me, she gave me all her pills

Now she begging, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said, it won't be long before she falls out of love
Won't be long before she falls out of love

Just a bird, tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you

And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I beg, I beg

Feel that through my pennant
Babygirl I gotcha

Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, weed
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'mma give you what you fiend

But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
'Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I get with the fuckin' loose girls
By the way I fuckin' did it
And you won't ever fuckin' know
'Cause I won't ever fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from that other cup of potion

Dirty spiked toastin
Fast life fuck slow
Low life for life
Let the mix flow
Let the night flow
I'm so gone
Let these meds flow

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Now your thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognize
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
'Cause I've been on these streets way too long
Baby I've been on this too long

It's getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another seroton'
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing 'bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking till I can't hit another note
Ooh, but until then

I got you
Baby I got you
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you
So baby love me
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me
Because they all left me
I'll be different
I think I'll be different
I hope I'm not different
And I hope you'll still listen
But until then
Baby I got you

Girl I still got you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I'm paying for all my father's sins
So I will thank him for you

My serotonin's got a while to go
Girl, it's gone cause of you

They say, they want heaven
They say, they want God

Well I say, I am God

I never prayed a moment in my life
Girl I'm rewarded with you
I've been rewarded with you
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh

Oh no

You'll never make me stay so take your head off of me
I know your every move so won't you please let me be?
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"

Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, oh

Dirty Diana, ooh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana
Let me be, ooh

She said, "I have to go home 'cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight"
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone, sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
I said, "Unlock the door because I forgot the key"
She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Baby girl you know what's in store
Baby I will stay up all night

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes, cabbed all day
Took the bus back home, evictions on your door
Blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, 'cause I get it, you're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin' 'specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke, you need more bread
Now you got no rent, you blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day, hipster nights downtown
And your daddy don't know you're out

If they don't let you in, you know where to find me
'Cause if you wanna go again, you can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind, you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

XO, oh, don't you forget
XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO, yeah, XO, whoa

I love it when your eyes are red
Ah yeah, are you on my cloud yet?
'Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV?
Oh why, I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess, you look so depressed
And you're filled with regret and you feel like you gotta go home
'Cause these nights pass so much quicker then the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for your face lift
Lust over love is your mindset
Waken up with most of your side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
'Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

If they won't let you in, you know where to find me, oh
And if you wanna go again, you can always call me
'Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone
Baby just be honest

XO, oh, don't you forget
XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO, yeah, XO, whoa

I need, I need something from you
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far

I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I need from you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out, oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out, oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out, ooh
Just ride it

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Oh yeah
Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas, all this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low, my eyes red but my brim low, that XO, she climbing
Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living
The party won't finish it's a fucking celebration (oh yeah)

For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work you don't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work you don't gotta check the sky
We been going all night, till light

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys

You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave 'cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up them teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out

Work that back till I tire out
Roll that weed, blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep 'em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' 'bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby, I bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you can ever do me right

You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

And now I'm poppin' yeah
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot every time you hear me playin' in the club

You never thought that I would ever go this far
(Never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential could never last this long

You can pick my voice to dance to
You say my money no good in here
Even though I didn't ask you
And it's the most you've worked
Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money baby
I wanna show you how I blow money baby
I wanna show you how I throw money baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
'Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some choppers on the car
What kind of caps I got the finest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good [x3]
I ain't scared of the fall [x4]
I felt the ground before [x4]
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall

Mama I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
Where it goin', no telling
But to make room, I'll vanish
Call a friend for my friend
And her friend's name's Lexis
I let my niggas test it
I'm always worth a cent
Best believe I'm already spent
My blunt full of BC
My cup full of Texas
Flowing on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "who's next?"

Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peek is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good [x3]
I ain't scared of the fall [x4]
I felt the ground before [x4]
'Cause I ain't scared of the fall

You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected, girl you're such a masochist and I ask, "Why?"
And you reply

"I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the seven

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then, watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad in a head band
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist
And when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I got her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool
That's just how we fuckin' livin'
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me
Ain't no offense though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street

La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Whip the 707 out
La la la la la la la la
I'm so gone so gone
Bring out the glass tables

Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things from which you can't escape"

Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others, oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear
You say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear
And the things which you cannot explain"

And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition

It's inside of my mind of mine
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind
Open up and see what's inside of my
My mind

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Climb on board
We'll go slow and high-tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us
Bodies together

I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always
I'd love to wake up next to you
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always
I'd love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbors
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking you and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's a thriller

I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me, 'body but us
Bodies together
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always
I'd love to wake up next to you
I'd love to hold you close, tonight and always
I'd love to wake up next to you

So we'll piss off the neighbors
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking you, fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone

So we'll piss off the neighbors
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking you, fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

She got, she got, she got
Her own reasons
For talking to me
And she don't, she don't, she don't
Give a fuck
About what I need
And I can't tell you why
Because my brain can't equate it

Tell me your lies
Because I just can't face it

It's you, it's you
It's you
It's you, it's you
It's you

I won't, I won't, I won't
Cover the scars
I'll let 'em bleed
So my silence
So my silence won't
Be mistaken for peace
Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?

Tell me your lies
Because I just can't face it

It's you, it's you
It's you
It's you, it's you
It's you

Could it be that it's a lesson
That I never had to learn?
I looked at it like a blessing
And now it's just a curse
I don't know why
I don't know why

It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you
It's you

I've done this before
Not like this

I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's something I want
I'll take all the right wrongs
Now, I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of picking that bone
And I can't be bothered to fight it no more, no

Numb on a roof
Set it on fire
Just to give me proof
I'm living on a wire
Numb on a roof
Set it on fire
Just to give me proof
I'm living on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before
Not like this, not like this

Time for me to move up
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords into your songs, no

Numb on a roof
Set it on fire
Just to give me proof
I'm living on a wire

So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before
Not like this, not like this

Flashing lights
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face

I've done this before
Not like this, not like this
I've done this before
Not like this, not like this

She puts her spirit in a nightcap
She always knows where the crowd's at
She puts her mouth round the cigarette
I put it out 'cause she likes that
She always dances when it's raining
"Aye, when's it starting baby?"
She looks at me like she's waiting
Making time go slow when they show her the table

Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy

She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way

She's crying out that she loves me
Holding my hands so I won't leave
'Cause baby don't wanna be lonely
She says "I just want you to hold me"

Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy

She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
In the right way
In the right way

In the right way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong, in the right way
In the right way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong, in the right way
In the wrong way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong, in the right way
In the wrong way, in the, in the, in the right way way
In the wrong, wrong

She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To hold her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way
She wants somebody to love
To kiss her
She wants somebody to love
In the right way

We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

Right now I can't see straight
Intoxicated it's true
When I'm with you
I'm buzzing and I feel laced
I'm coming from a different phase
When I'm with you

Run away now
Like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now
I take a shot for you
Wasted every night
Gone for every song
Faded every night
Dancing all night long

Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer
We be drunk all summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down

We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

Right now I'm emotional
I lose control, when I'm with you
I hope I haven't said too much
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you

Run away now
Like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now
I take a shot for you
Wasted every night
Gone for every song
Faded every night
Dancing all night long

Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer
We be drunk all summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down

We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
(You put your drinks up)
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer

Can your heart be mine in search?
'Cause I have no time to help you find
All the words
Melodies and memories
Stories that sound absurd
I will tell no lies

As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind

Heard about all the things you've done
And all the walls that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

Please don't wait
I'm not coming home tonight
I wanna love you but I can't

As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind

Heard about all the things you've done
And all the walls that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

I never doubted myself
But I doubted you
I'm tired of looking by myself
And not with you

Heard about all the things you've done
And all the walls that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
It sounds like you need a friend, a friend

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Oh when I, in the same light
Show me in the same light
Feels right, come and take flight
Clothes off and she so soft
This ain't a fair fight, yeah
What a shared love
Only so dry
I'll get her wetter than ever
Four letters is never the question
She likes when I'm messy
And I like when she's undressing

You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too

Here with you 'cause you got the right vibe
Seems like you probably gotta do mine
But it's gotta be the right time
We're only good for the night time
I see through your demeanor
Baby I'm a pleaser
I go out my way to treat you
But I can't be a teacher
'Cause I'm a problem with problems
I know who I am and I'm not no good
You can have me tonight and ever
I thought you understood
Baby some people are meant to be loved and others just naked
So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it

You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too

I don't, I don't really know
I don't, I don't really care
Maybe keep it on the low
With stories I don't wanna share
(Don't stop)

You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do

When you're looking like this
I just can't resist it
I know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time 'cause it's gonna defeat me
But if you won't believe me, believe me

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do

I know, I know given a chance I'd do it again
'Cause I can't help myself
'Cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do

This love is tainted

She is the life of the party
Don't stick that knife in my body
It's something she always wanted
It's for a good cause
You're doing a good job
We're off where the wind blows
I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean
You change what I see

They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me

So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So lets cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border

Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me

Guilty for insanity
Not like a movie
Change the scene
Taste your sweet profanity
This is all for a good cause
Think you're doing a good job

They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion
All because of me

So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So let's cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border

Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(You were right on border)

Give me all of this
Give me all of you
No falling in
Don't need no proof
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
No falling in
Don't need no proof

So take it off
Let's break down all of our walls
Right now I wanna see it all
I don't wanna cool off
So lets cross the lines we lost
Right now I wanna see it all
You were right on the border

Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me
(You were right on border)
Give me all of this
Give me all of you
Don't follow me
Don't lean on me

My luck's on the game
Can't find a way through
Don't know how many times
I had to say this to you
This ain't my scene
This wasn't my dream
It was all yours
And of course
I got caught up in this game
And you know I won't say names
Of who's to blame

I won't point any fingers
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time
Any time you'll see the truth
I won't ask any questions
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time
Any time you'll see the truth

See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth

My own mind was in the way
Front seat, new view
Don't know how many times
I've had to talk you through
My dreams, new scenes with enemies
I got caught up in this game
A game

I won't point any fingers
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time
Any time you'll see the truth

See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth

I tried
Hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try, hide it all
Don't try to hide it all
Don't try, don't try
Don't try, hide it all up

I won't point any fingers
I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time
Any time you'll see the truth

See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth
See the truth

I'm sipping pink
Lucozade
We're blazing on that new found haze
I'm seeing in the blacks and grays
I'm hoping that the basket sways
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night
Does that make it right for smoke
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear

You don't even wanna know about the things I hear
Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deal
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you
Your position
You'll be fishing for far too long
You're the bad guy in this movie
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution
And the only solution is making shit confusing
And it ain't about who's winning or losing

It's 'bout the path you're choosing
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing
When the scars are gone you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings
I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me

Bulls eye you the dot to me
Emotions splattered, same pattern
Can't even begin to spot 'em
I'm sad about shit that never happened
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out
I'm, tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out

She's older, I told her
We ain't meant to be
It takes two not three, but I'm here any way
I hope he's leaving soon
Started not to see the elephant in this room
Disguise is your perfume
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
You can search the world but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me
Be there, you run to me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina
If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya
Kept runnin'
Outwit, 'cause you cunnin'
That outfit 'cause you stunnin'
Begging 'cause I'm losing mage
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain
The fuck is going on?
I think I got it wrong
When I told you I was over you, or were you under me?

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I can taste it on your mouth
And I can't leave it
You're a freak like me
Can't you see?
We can work this something out
And I'm believin'
You get off on me
It's like cheating

I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off

Put you up against the wall
Don't take it easy
You like it hard like me
It's what you need
Let's get naked and explore
Our inner secrets
For what it is
It's what it is

I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off
Take it off, take it off, take it off, baby just take it off

I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on
I just can't wait to see it all
I'm so turned on

I, I, I, I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when then take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your makeup when you take it off
I just want to watch you when you take it off
Take off all your clothes and watch you take them off

In the clouds where the angels sing
In your eyes, where I wanna be
And her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion
I need her body
Needs me too

I need somebody to
Love me blue

I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long

In the clouds where the angels sing
It's her smile, yeah it's so glassy
In her eyes, where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion

She needs me too

I need somebody to love
Love me blue

I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd

I'm loving the colorway
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you

For the love in my mind
Love for the bass
She likes getting high just for the day
She's different in night, she knows what I say
Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes
I don't know you

I'm loving the colorway
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright

I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright

I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again

I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright

Hey what's up, it's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up
While I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late but I'm so wired
Saw your face and got inspired
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted

It's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
If we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that

He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would

Talkin' don't want me, 'cause I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted

It's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
If we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that

He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right

Love you like I would, like I would

I, I need you
I, I don't
I question myself all the time, asking what
I don't know
It's kinda hard to walk right
When you're walking on my left
With your high heels on
And your sexy ass dress
I see you talking on your phone, phone
Wish I could get you on your own, own
But I've seen you gone over love

I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around

I want you
Your body
I want you
Your body on top of mine

I, I want you
I, I don't
I question myself all the time, asking why
I don't know
It's kinda hard to walk right
When you're walking on my left
With your high heels on
And your sexy ass dress
I see you talking on your phone, phone
Wish I could get you on your own, own
But I've seen you gone over love

I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around

I want you
Your body
I want you
Your body on top of mine

Should we wait till the morning?
See it loud in your eyes
Can't escape what I'm feeling
Your body on top of mine

I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around
I think I know she don't love me
That's why I fuck around

I want you
Your body on top of mine
I want you
Your body on top of mine

I smoke two joints before I play video games
Then I get 10,000 points
I flew around this planet only yesterday
Because I am an alien

I seen this galaxy and Milky Way
I even watched the sun
I got a J givin' me my light away
Because I don't get drunk

Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late

Three more joints and I'm still playing video games
Can't even count the points
Play it 'til my fingers bleed
Who said that tomorrow will be guaranteed?

Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day

It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be

Every single jigsaw piece
Seems to be incomplete

The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows

It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright
Look through the light and see, it's meant to be

Every single jigsaw piece

There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows

'Cause it grows and it grows
And I hope that you know

The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

In the beginning
God created heaven and Earth
But for what it's worth
I think that he might've created you first

Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to
Every day
And every night

I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry
So sorry!
I'm sorry!
Yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is gettin' serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us

How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again
All over again
No, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition
Tells me that I'm doin' you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry!
Yeah

I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

You know, I roar like a lion
For you, you know I'll be trying till the sun starts rising

I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, alright)

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't laugh, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, darling)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
(All night, all night)
Let's get lost in the light, baby

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby you should touch me right there
You can take me right there
We can make it

Hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscing on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me

Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting to fifths
Biting your lip
Loving too late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah
(Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah...)

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're digging the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?

Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing, but a smile on me
But tonight, I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
Don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden

Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

Maybe one day I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

3 AM and my neighbours hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time mary-jane won't save me
 
I've been working later
I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
Like poison coursing through me
So clear, my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind out it
 
I've been sleeping later
I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
(I want you all)
Say it before you run outta time
(I want you all)
Say it before it's too late
(I want you all)
Say what I am feeling, oh
(I want you all)
Waiting is insane
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

(One, one, one...)

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love
He makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it
'Cause I
(I got new, I got new, I got new...)

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(Oh, whoa-oh)
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I've gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't let him in, don't let him in

All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
All my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
Not running away

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever

Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops
Then, darling, what will I do
And I know I go all in
But why do I

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over
That watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

You give me a reason
Something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning
Something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie
But I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you

Oh, I wish I was there with you

Last night, my fantasies become oh-so true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'll be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know

And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel

It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is a-ticking, we gotta leave now
Time is a-ticking, and we gotta leave town tonight

Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown looking down
Hoping I want it

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for 2
You should've never done something like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos I see through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

I hope that one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Now it's getting quiet here
Now it's getting blue
And this baby ain't no fair
Taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies
I've been thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes
The things that you do

I don't wanna waste more time all alone
Want somewhere to go
Something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
When you go
Outside of the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me
And I've been far and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe
And I need some new love, new love, new love

Even though I found a way
I still come back
Know there's nothing more to say
It's all been said
I've been trying to explain
Nothing we hide
To all of my friends who say
That I've gone mad

I don't wanna waste more time all alone
Want somewhere to go
Something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied
When you go
Outside of the road, washed up on the shore

And I need some new love, new love, new love
Easy come, easy go, why?
I've been living on, living on
Living on, give it all, give it all
Can't I just let it go?

'Cause I wait for a miracle
I wait for a miracle, yeah!
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me
And I've been far and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder, and harder to breathe
And I need some new love, new love, new love

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You see that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)

Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Nothing can stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up and run from the scene
When I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm better than I've ever been

Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Fatal, this attraction
Yeah we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothing back
Like it's our last dance!

Like it's our last dance!

Like it's our last dance!
My eyes wide open, fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burning like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you are I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait till we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Tighten this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance!

Like it's our last dance!

Like it's our last dance!

Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon I feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long

In the beginning
God created heaven and Earth
But for what it's worth
I think that he might've created you first

Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise
That I wanna fly to
Every day
And every night

I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry
So sorry!
I'm sorry!
Yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is gettin' serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us

How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again
All over again
No, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition
Tells me that I'm doin' you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I been sick and tired or runnin'
Chasin' all of the flashin' lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologise
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry!
Yeah

I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

You know, I roar like a lion
For you, you know I'll be trying till the sun starts rising

I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
I need your love and I'm dying for the rush
Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

'Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby you should touch me right there
You can take me right there
We can make it

Hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you

No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscing on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
(I'll tell you why)

You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a fuck)

I see you tryna' get to me

Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me (get to me)

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting to fifths
Biting your lip
Loving too late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind
Mwah!

And tonight I'm alive, ain't a dollar sign
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind, mwah

Yeah, I'm so bad
Best that you've had
I guess you're digging the show
Open the door
You want some more
When you wanna leave, let me know

You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed

And this baby ain't no fair
Taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies

And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryina get you to come back to me

Maybe one day I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (no goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

Maybe one day I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes

Pretend that it's all all right (all all right)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?

3 AM and my neighbours hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time mary-jane won't save me
 
I've been working later
I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
Like poison coursing through me
So clear, my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind out it
 
I've been sleeping later
I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper
But the memories won't stop
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
(I want you all)
Say it before you run outta time
(I want you all)
Say it before it's too late
(I want you all)
Say what I am feeling, oh
(I want you all)
Waiting is insane
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high
I can't get by
I can't get through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown looking down
Hoping I want it

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for 2
You should've never done something like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos I see through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

I hope that one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm

Lost in your light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby (Alright)
Let's get lost in the light, baby (Alright)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck (Don't need a paycheck)
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't laugh, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Let's get lost in the light, baby (All night)
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Let's get lost in the light, baby

I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You see that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay (Baby, you're okay)

Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Nothing can stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up and run from the scene
When I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm better than I've ever been

Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn just as long as you care
Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?

Used to walk around your apartment
With nothing, but a smile on me
But tonight, I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in paradise
Don't know what it's worth till you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

So are we leaving this garden of eden?
Are we leaving this garden of eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)
This garden of eden
(Eden, eden, eden...)

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hit my head against the wall

What you got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

CHORUS:
Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mom's telling me I should think twice
But love to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
(All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

So I got a question:
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, huh your drug?
Your drug, huh your drug
Huh your drug, is my love your drug?

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Because your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love
Your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Hey! Hey!
So...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love...
...is my drug
I like your beard

Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
You got me now
You got that sound
Yeah, you got me

DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me

With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands up
Now the party don't start till I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they... 

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive,
Looking for something wild

And now we looking like pimps
In my Gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on,
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around

And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't
Oh!

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh... 
Everybody take it off!
Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh...
Everybody take it off

Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Ohhh...woah

Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
(Oh...) Everybody take it off

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on

Listen to yourself you're a hot mess
St-t-tutter through your words breaking a sweat
What's it gonna take to confess?
What we both know

Yeah, I was outta town last weekend
You were feeling like a pimp round your lame friends
Now your little party's gonna end
So here we go

(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you got a secret
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you couldn't keep it
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) somebody leaked it
And now some shit's about to go down

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell

You really should have kept it in your pants
I'm hearing dirty stories from your friends
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh
Kiss and tell
Uh-oh-oh

You're looking like a tool and not a baller (baller)
You're acting like a chick why bother? (bother)
I can find someone way hotter
With a bigger, wow
Well

'Cause on top of all the ways that you messed up (messed up)
You weren't smart enough to keep your stupid mouth shut (mouth shut)
I'm so sick of it I've had enough
I hope you die

(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you got a secret
(Wow-oh-oh-oh-oh) you couldn't keep it

And now some shit's about to go down

Oh, I hope you know
You gotta go
Yo, get up and go
I don't wanna know
Cover why you're gross
You gotta go
Yo, get up and go
I don't wanna know

I never thought that you would be the one
Acting like a slut when I was gone
Maybe you shouldn't, uh-oh

Why won't you call me?
Stephen
Why won't you call me?

I saw you
In your tight ass rocker pants
You saw me too
I laughed
'Cause I was completely trashed
And I watched your ugly girlfriend
Sneered across the room
As if I really care
That she's here with you

All I know is
You're my object of affection
My drug of choice
My sick obsession

Stephen

Why won't you call me?

I can't take rejection
(Stephen)
Why won't you call me?

I've got guys
Waiting in a line
For me to play
My evil girly games
With all their minds
Just watch me
I've got it down
To a simple art
Just bat my eyes
Like this
And there's a broken heart

But somehow
You turn the tables
What the hell?
I can charm the pants off anyone else
But you

Why won't you call me?

Crazy
Is that why you won't
Call me?

Don't you think I'm
Pretty?
Do you not
Love me?
Is that why you won't call me?

'Cause you're my object of affection
My drug of choice
My sick obsession
I want to keep you as my pet to play with
And hide under my bed forever

Zip your lips like a padlock, (Yeah)
And meet me in the back with the Jack

Wanna dance with no pants on?

And now the sun is rising
Now the long walk back home (back home)
There's just so many faces,
But no one I need to know (need to know)

In the dark I can fight it, I fight till I'm numb
But in the bright light,
I taste you on my tongue

Now the party's over
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?

Even my dirty laundry
Everything just smells like you (like you)
And now my head is throbbing
Every song is out of tune
Just like you

In the dark I can fight till it disappears
But in the daylight
I taste you in my tears

And now the party's over,
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?

Now I've got myself looking like a mess
Standing alone trying to pretend but no,
I put up my fight
But this is it this time (time)
'Cause I'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
I'm here in the end, tryin' to pretend
Oh, oh

And now the party's over,
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?

And now the party's over,
And everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong

You're sleepin' with the enemy
You left me all alone, alone, alone, alone

Here we go, welcome to my funeral
Without you I don't even have a pulse
All alone it's dark and cold
With every move I die

Here I go, this is my confession oh
Lost cause, nobody can save my soul
I am so delusional
With every move I die

I have destroyed our life, it's gone
Payback is sick, it's all my fault

I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

I'm fading, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

When did I become such a hypocrite?
Double life, lies that you caught me in
Trust me I'm paying for it
With every move I die

On the floor I'm just a zombie
Who I am is not who I wanna be
I'm such a tragedy
With every move I die

I have destroyed our life, it's gone
Payback is sick, it's all my fault

I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

I'm fading, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

Oh, this is it and now your really gone this time
Oh, never once thought I'd be in pieces left behind

I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

I'm fading, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing air (losing air, losing air)
With every move I die

(Boots, Boys)
I think it's time that I mention
I've got myself an obsession
For the smell, for the touch
I know I got myself a habit
But I've got to have it now
I don't care, work it out
(Let me break it down)

I try it on, I take it off
So what you got?
Something about

Boots and boys (boots and boys)
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)
I gotta say it I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city
Watch out! Boots and boys
(Give me boots and boys)

I'm keeping quite the collection
Take nothing less than perfection
Cowboy boots, cowboy boys
Mmhmm oh the joy

My men drop beats like a bomb
Excuse me, now huh?
Wind me up, spin me 'round
Oh lookie what I've found

Boots and boys (boots and boys)
They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)
I gotta say it I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city
Watch out! Boots and boys
(Give me boots and boys)

Crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you (give me boots and boys)

Hey
Whatcha lookin' at?
Hey
Something you can't have
Yeah
They've got me lookin' rad

They bring me so much joy (bring me joy)
I gotta say it I wear 'em both so pretty as I walk in the city
Watch out! Boots and boys

I am in love with what we are
Not what we should be
And I am, I am starstruck with every part
Of this whole story

So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside, let it live and die

This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die

I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight
Into the magic
And I don't want the concrete, I am alive
Comes with the tragic

So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die

This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing

Rawr!

I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not, baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry
When you say you love me
Hush, if you know what's good for you

I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous
You're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you, fool

I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty
I drink their blood

Carnivore, animal
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run

I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up

Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter patter
I want your liver on a platter

Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner
Yep, I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer

I eat boys up
Breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty
I drink their blood

Carnivore, animal
I am a cannibal
I eat boys up
You better run

I am cannibal
I am cannibal
I'll eat you up
I am cannibal

I'll eat you up

Oh ooh whoa oh

I miss your soft lips
I miss your white sheets
I miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
And this is so hard
'Cause I didn't see
That you were the love of my life
And it kills me
I see your face in
Strangers on the street
I still say your name when I'm talking in my sleep
And in the limelight
I play it off fine
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light
Oh Oh Oh Oh
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light
Oh Oh Oh Oh

They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

Remember the time
We jumped the fence when
The Stones were playing and we were too broke to get in
You held my hand and
They made me cry while
I swore to God it was the best night of my life
Or when you took me
Across the world we
Promised that this would last forever but now I see
It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise

They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sun rise
(Till the sun rise)
(Till the sun rise)

They say that true love hurts
Well this could almost kill me
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

The life is fading from me
While you watch my heart bleed
Young love murdered
That is what this must be
I would give it all to not be sleeping alone

I'm in love all right
With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Wakin' up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah, I guess we're doing all right

Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love
Oh oh oh
'Til the Sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh
Just livin' the life
Oh oh oh

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life

I just hope some people see
There's nothing that I'm trying to be
Let me just stop all the shit talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been broke, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now, guess it worked out
Got here my running my mouth

Oh oh oh
We're fallin' in love
Oh oh oh
'Til the Sun's comin' up
Oh oh oh
Just livin' the life
Oh oh oh

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right
Something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times
For something real
In this crazy life

Every single night we...

Every single night we fight
To get a little high on life
To get a little something right

Last night I had enough of you
I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard
It was all over your face
That you were slippin' and flippin'
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a man
But you are just a bitch

You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking
'Bout you nonstop
But you cried bout this
And whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think your hot
I think your all right
But your acting like
A chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When I first met you
Panties droppin'
Everytime I saw you
It was on and
One day you asked if we could just talk
And that's reason why I'm walkin'
If I am honest
I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin' to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you and you got confused

You should know
That I love
You a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking
'Bout you nonstop
But you cried bout this
And whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think you're hot
I think your all right
But your acting like
A chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not just like that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When you grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back
Grow a pear
You can call me back
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Oh
Grow a pear
You can call me back
And no I don't want to see your man-gina
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

When we fell in love
You made my heart drop
And you had me thinking
'Bout you nonstop
But you cried bout this
And whine about that
When you grow a pear
You can call me back

Yeah I think you're hot
I think your all right
But your acting like

You were cool and now you're not just like that

I was looking lost, it was cold outside
The whiskey rocks how you caught my eye
My red lips painted, just got them black
I needed something to bring me back
You knew the play and we danced all night
But something wasn't right

So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate
Or I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve when I know you have a girlfriend
I'll see you next Tuesday
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

You won't call and you won't admit
The lies you spin for your power trip
And I just can't take you seriously
When all you send is a text to me
So I'll be gone when the morning comes
Let's not pretend it's love

So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate
Or I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve when I know you have a girlfriend
I'll see you next Tuesday
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

I don't want anything from this
I got your number, don't call me I'll call you if I need a hit
Oh

So I'll see you next Tuesday
(I'll see you next Tuesday)

So I'll see you next Tuesday
If I ever get desperate
Or I'm so beyond faded
Just said I'll see you next Tuesday
Kinda nice how this morning I would sit around waiting
And I'm not just being cold I'm just watching you pretend
Like your heart is on your sleeve when I know you have a girlfriend
(Know you have a girlfriend, Yeah I know you have a girlfriend)
So I'll see you next Tuesday

Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Drop-topping, playing our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh

Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk
Now, now, we goin' till they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard, I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I don't know what I want,
So, don't ask me,
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking,
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one,
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on
My old blue jeans,
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today,
Got the sunshine,
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery,
Oh yeah, but, that's okay

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl,
Trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl, 
On a mission
But, I'm ready to fly

I'm alone,
On my own,
And that's all I know
I'll be strong,
I'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm alone,
On my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls,
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you,
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story,
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
So, just walk away,
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody,
If I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending, 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through,
I've never been anywhere cold as you

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

I didn't know,
What I would find,
When I went lookin' for a reason
I know,
I didn't read,
Between the lines,
And baby I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever,
Try to be better
Nobody ever,
Let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there,
But never knew
That I would give it all just to be
A part of this,
A part of you
And now it's all too late
So you see,
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But, no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever,
Try to be better
Nobody ever,
Let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah
How can I ever,
Try to be better
Nobody ever,
Let's me in
And I can still see you,
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh oh
Ah, oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,
But, that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But, he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high and you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows, 
That you cry,
But, you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone
You're tied together with a smile
But, you're coming undone

Goodbye, baby,
With a smile
Baby, baby, oh

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch his as he's walking home
Saying does he know
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So, I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make conversation,
When he's takin' my breath away
I should say,
Hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but, if it don't
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story,
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream,
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but, if it don't

Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

Oh, if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles
The flowers
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, "yes"

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

She said "I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
The pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the house and the backyard trees
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Took me back when the world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh, my, my, my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights
And our daddy's used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes,
And said "Oh, my, my, my"

Took me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. running in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Took me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slamming up doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside
Till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my

A few years have gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,
And you looked at me
Got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came
And our mamas cried
You said "I do"
And I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
You and I

I'll be eighty seven
You'll be eighty nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh, my, my, my

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is somethin' wrong?"
I say, "Nothing, I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song"
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home
For I said, "Hey, man!"
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home
For I said, "Hey, man!"
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I've heard every hour and listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home
For I said, "Hey, man!"
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets all my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
Only you can see

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me, who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable,
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna look in your eyes
And make you realise

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realised by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall

No matter what you say
I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

DJ:
Hey, a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?

Tim McGraw:
I have heard this song.

DJ:
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?

Tim:
It was awesome. Uh, except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.

DJ:
*Laughs*

Tim:
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more... I don't know if it's true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.

DJ:
Why don't we find out? Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?

Taylor:
Oh it's definitely a compliment. Yeah.

*Laughs*

DJ:
Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.

Tim:
Nice-

Taylor:
Nice to meet you.

Tim:
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?

Taylor:
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

Tim:
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record! It's doing great.

Taylor:
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker. 

*Laughs*

DJ:
Well-

Taylor:
The funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.

*Laughs*

Tim:
Well I'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya.

DJ:
So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked?

Tim:
No.

DJ:
You haven't met?

Tim:
No.

Taylor:
No, we've never talked or met or anything.

Tim:
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.

Taylor:
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.

Tim:
They didn't? Okay well, there ya go. I did.

*Laughs*

DJ:
So I-I

Taylor:
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.

Tim:
Not at all.

DJ:
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called "Tim McGraw" without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?

Taylor:
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.

Tim:
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-

Taylor:
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?

Tim:
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.

Taylor:
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.

Tim:
I agree.

DJ:
This, this... tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?

Taylor:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...

*Laughs*

Taylor:
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.

Tim:
Now I feel old.

Taylor:
And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.

Tim:
Aww, thank you.

Taylor:
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out all right. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well that's your first single"

*Laughs*

Taylor:
"And I'm like "well..."

Tim:
Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.

*Laughs*

Taylor:
That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.

Tim:
All right, great.

*Laughs*

Tim:
Well congratulations 'cause it's your first single, first top ten hit and that's pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.

Taylor:
Awesome, it's been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?

Tim:
Um I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.

*Laughs*

Taylor:
Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.

Tim:
Ya do? What would-

Taylor:
Yeah.

Tim:

Taylor:
Uh, um I think Taylor something.

Tim:
Something like that yeah.

Taylor:

Taylor:

DJ:

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

"Merry Christmas" - I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl under cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special

Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special

<SONG_BOUNDARY>

Please take down the mistleoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doing all right if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyon's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everynbody
That'll have to be something I just say this year

Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases whe I didn't
Wonder how you are tonight
